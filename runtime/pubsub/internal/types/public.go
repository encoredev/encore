	// ExactlyOnce guarantees that a message for a subscription is delivered to
	// a consumer exactly once, to the best of the system's ability.
	//
	// However, there are edge cases when a message might be redelivered.
	// For example, if a networking issue causes the acknowledgement of success
	// processing the message to be lost before the cloud provider receives it.
	//
	// It is also important to note that the ExactlyOnce delivery guarantee only
	// applies to the delivery of the message to the consumer, and not to the
	// original publishing of the message, such that if a message is published twice,
	// such as due to an retry within the application logic, it will be delivered twice.
	// (i.e. ExactlyOnce delivery does not imply message deduplication on publish)
	//
	// As such it's recommended that the subscription handler function is idempotent
	// and is able to handle duplicate messages.
	//
	// Subscriptions attached to ExactlyOnce topics have higher message delivery latency compared to AtLeastOnce.
	//
	// By using ExactlyOnce semantics on a topic, the throughput will be limited depending on the cloud provider:
	//
	// - AWS: 300 messages per second for the topic (see [AWS SQS Quotas]).
	// - GCP: At least 3,000 messages per second across all topics in the region
	// 		  (can be higher on the region see [GCP PubSub Quotas]).
