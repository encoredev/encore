// discoverServices discovers the services in the whole application.
//
// Services are defined as a collection of packages which are considered
// to form a single logical service, which can be deployed and scaled as an
// atomic unit.
//
// Services are defined by a root filesystem directory, with everything under
// that directory considered part of the service.
//
// This means services cannot be nested, and a service cannot be split across
// multiple filesystem directories (such as in separate git repositories).
//
// It operates in three phases:
//
// 1. Find any API Framework service structs and mark those packages as services (service structs are always the root of a service)
// 2. Find any API Framework API's not currently in a service and mark those packages as services
// 3. Find any PubSub subscribers not currently in a service and mark those packages as services
//
// This does not setup the service framework data.
//
// The returned slice is sorted by service name.
