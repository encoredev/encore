// #Meta contains metadata about the running Encore application.

// referenced from other config values for example when configuring a callback URL:
//    CallbackURL: "\(#Meta.APIBaseURL)/webhooks.Handle`"

// #Config is the top level configuration for the application and is generated
// from the Go types you've passed into `config.Load[T]()`. Encore uses a definition
// of this struct which is closed, such that the CUE tooling can any typos of field names.
// this definition is then immediately inlined, so any fields within it are expected
// as fields at the package level.

	// Foo is great in Otherconfig
	// And even better in ThisConfig
	Foo:      string
	Bar:      int
	Name:     string // The users name
	Port:     uint16
	ReadOnly: bool // true if we're in read only mode
	Baz:      bool
