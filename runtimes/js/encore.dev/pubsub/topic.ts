/**

 *
 * However, there are edge cases when a message might be redelivered.
 * For example, if a networking issue causes the acknowledgement of success
 * processing the message to be lost before the cloud provider receives it.
 *
 * It is also important to note that the ExactlyOnce delivery guarantee only
 * applies to the delivery of the message to the consumer, and not to the
 * original publishing of the message, such that if a message is published twice,
 * such as due to an retry within the application logic, it will be delivered twice.
 * (i.e. ExactlyOnce delivery does not imply message deduplication on publish)
 *
 * As such it's recommended that the subscription handler function is idempotent
 * and is able to handle duplicate messages.
 *
 * Subscriptions attached to ExactlyOnce topics have higher message delivery latency compared to AtLeastOnce.
 *
 * By using ExactlyOnce semantics on a topic, the throughput will be limited depending on the cloud provider:
 * - AWS: 300 messages per second for the topic (see [AWS SQS Quotas]).
 * - GCP: At least 3,000 messages per second across all topics in the region
 *      (can be higher on the region see [GCP PubSub Quotas]).

   *
   * If OrderingAttribute is not set, messages can be delivered in any order.
   *
   * It is important to note, that in the case of an error being returned by a
   * subscription handler, the message will be retried before any subsequent
   * messages for that ordering key are delivered. This means depending on the
   * retry configuration, a large backlog of messages for a given ordering key
   * may build up. When using OrderingAttribute, it is recommended to use reason
   * about your failure modes and set the retry configuration appropriately.
   *
   * Once the maximum number of retries has been reached, the message will be
   * forwarded to the dead letter queue, and the next message for that ordering
   * key will be delivered.
   *
   * To create attributes on a message, use the `Attribute` type:
   *
   *  type UserEvent = {
   *    user_id: Attribute<string>;
   *    action:  string;
   *  }

   *    orderingAttribute: "user_id", // Messages with the same user-id will be delivered in the order they where
   * published
   *  })
   *
   *  topic.publish(ctx, {user_id: "1", action: "login"})  // This message will be delivered before the logout
   *  topic.publish(ctx, {user_id: "2", action: "login"})  // This could be delivered at any time because it has a different user id
   *  topic.publish(ctx, {user_id: "1", action: "logout"}) // This message will be delivered after the first message
   *
   * By using OrderingAttribute, the throughput will be limited depending on the cloud provider:
   *
   * - AWS: 300 messages per second for the topic (see [AWS SQS Quotas]).
   * - GCP: 1MB/s for each ordering key (see [GCP PubSub Quotas]).
   *
   * Note: OrderingAttribute currently has no effect during local development.
