Encore applications have three membership roles with different permissions: **Admins**, **Members**, and **Viewers**.
Here is a breakdown of the key differences between each role:

|   | Admins | Members | Viewers |
| - | - | - | - |
| Manage team members | Y | N | N |
| Connect/Disconnect cloud accounts | Y | N | N |
| Integrate with GitHub | Y | N | N |
| Configure custom domains | Y | N | N |
| Manage environments | Y | N | N |
| Create auth keys | Y | N | N |
| Approve infrastructure provisioning | Y | N | N |
| Delete applications | Y | N | N |
| Push code changes | Y | Y | N |
| Create builds & deployments | Y | Y | N |

| Pull secrets | Y | Y | Y |
| Run locally | Y | Y | Y |
| View API documentation | Y | Y | Y |
| View Encore Flow | Y | Y | Y |


### Admins

Admins have full privileges and can administer your entire application.

### Members

Members are active contributors to your applications. They are able to do everything that is not limited to Admins.
  
### Viewers

Viewers are read-only members. They can view the Cloud Dashboard and run your application locally.
Viewers are free of charge, but are included in the total member count for determining your plan.

This role is intended for any team members not contributing directly to your Encore application,
but who still get value from certain access. In a bigger team, this role is often appropriate for e.g. Frontend developers and Product Managers.

### Custom roles & permissions

Support for defining custom roles and permissions is currently in development, please [contact us](mailto:hello@encore.dev) if you need it for your team.
