### Admins

Admins have full privileges and can administer your entire application.

### Members

Members are active contributors to your applications. They are able to do everything that is not limited to Admins.
  
### Viewers

Viewers are "read-only" and are **not** counted as members toward a paid plan.
This role is intended for any team members not contributing directly to your Encore application,
but who still get value from certain access. In a bigger team, this role is often appropriate for e.g. Frontend developers and Product Managers.

### Custom roles & permissions

Support for defining custom roles and permissions is currently in development, please [contact us](mailto:hello@encore.dev) if you need it for your team.
