Encore offers a **Free** plan for teams that want a simple development workflow and collaboration features.
If you want access to all features and want to use Encore's DevOps automation tools for AWS & GCP, there's a paid **Pro** plan available at $39 per member / month.

See the [pricing page](https://encore.dev/pricing) for a feature comparison between each plan and more information.

## When do I need to upgrade to a paid plan?

The Free plan comes with certain limitations, and should your needs exceed one or more of them, you may wish to upgrade to a paid plan:

- When you need more than 2 cloud environments
- When you want to [automate DevOps in your cloud on AWS/GCP](/docs/deploy/infra)
- When you want [Preview Environments](/docs/deploy/preview-environments) for each Pull Request
- When you want to use a Custom Domain
- When you need multiple concurrent builds
- When you need guaranteed logs & tracing retention
- When you want access to private support & onboarding assistance
- When you want custom configuration for environments hosted on Encore Cloud

There is a free 14-day trial of the Pro plan, available to all new Encore users. It's a great way to try out all the features and learn if the Pro plan suits your needs.
You can activate your trial from the [pricing page](https://encore.dev/pricing).

## Do I need to pay for hosting?

All plans come with free use of Encore Cloud, subject to [Fair Use limits](/docs/about/usage).
Encore Cloud is intended for development environments and limited scale professional use that does not require specific SLAs.

For production use, you can [connect your own cloud account on AWS/GCP](/docs/deploy/own-cloud) and use Encore to deploy there, including provisioning infrastructure and managing IAM. When you connect your own cloud account, you pay for usage directly to your cloud provider.

If you prefer to manage deployment yourself, you can export your application as a standalone Docker image and deploy in any way you prefer. ([Learn more](/docs/how-to/migrate-away#ejecting-your-app-as-a-docker-image))
