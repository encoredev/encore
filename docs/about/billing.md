Encore comes with a free-forever **Hobby** plan for prototyping, hobby projects, and small-scale use.
When you have a more ambitious project, there are paid **Pro** and **Enterprise** plans available to support your use case.

See the [pricing page](https://encore.dev/pricing) for a feature comparison between each plan.

## When do I need to upgrade to a paid plan?

The free Hobby plan comes with certain limitations, and should your needs exceed one or more of them, you may wish to upgrade to a paid plan:

- When you have more than 2 team members
- When you need more than 2 environments
- When you want to automate DevOps for environments in your cloud on AWS/GCP
- When you want to use a Custom Domain
- When you need multiple concurrent builds
- When you need guaranteed logs & tracing retention
- When you want access to private support & onboarding assistance
- When you want to customize performance characteristics for preview and development environments hosted on Encore Cloud.

There is a free 14-day trial of the Pro plan, available to all new Encore users. It's a great way to try out all the features, to learn if the Pro plan suits your needs.
You can activate your trial from the [pricing page](https://encore.dev/pricing).

## Do I need to pay for hosting?

All plans come with free use of Encore Cloud, subject to [Fair Use limits](/docs/about/usage).
Encore Cloud is intended for [Preview Environments](/docs/deploy/preview-environments), development environment, and non-business-critical use.

For production use, you can [connect your own cloud account](/docs/deploy/own-cloud) and use Encore deploy there, including provisioning infrastructure and managing IAM.
When you connect your own cloud account, you will pay for any usage directly to your cloud provider.

If you wish, you can also export your application as a standalone Docker image and deploy in any way you prefer. ([Learn more](/docs/how-to/migrate-away#ejecting-your-app-as-a-docker-image))
