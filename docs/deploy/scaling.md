subtitle: From zero to one to millions

Encore applications automatically scale up and down to meet your traffic demands.
Whether that means a single user or hundreds of millions, building your application
with Encore gives you the peace of mind that your application scales to meet your needs
while at the same time reducing your cloud bill.

Under the hood this is implemented using Kubernetes autoscaling groups,
which monitor the CPU and memory usage of your application and determines
how many instances should be started or shut down to match your traffic requirements.

Whether you use Encore Cloud or deploy to your own cloud, all of this is handled
for you so you don't have to think about it. All so you can focus on what matters:
building your product.
