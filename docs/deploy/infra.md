subtitle: How Encore provisions infrastructure for your application
---

Encore automatically provisions all necessary infrastructure, in all environments and across all major cloud providers, without requiring application code changes. You simply [connect your cloud account](./own-cloud) and create an environment.

<img src="/assets/docs/encore_overview.png" title="Infrastructure Overview" className="noshadow"/>

This is powered by Encore's [Infrastructure SDK](/docs/primitives/overview), which lets you write regular Go code and declare infrastructure resources (databases, caches, queues, and scheduled jobs) in application code.

At compile time, Encore creates an [Application Model](/docs/introduction#meet-the-encore-application-model) with a definition of the infrastructure your application requires. Encore then uses this model to provision the infrastructure in both your cloud account, and development and preview environments in Encore Cloud.

The approach removes the need for infrastructure configuration files and avoids creating cloud-specific dependencies in your application.

Having an end-to-end integration between application code and infrastructure also enables Encore to keep environments in sync and track cloud infrastructure, giving you an up-to-date view of your infrastructure to avoid unnecessary cloud costs.

## Environment types

By default, Encore provisions infrastructure using contextually appropriate objectives for each environment type. You retain control and configurability of infrastructure in your cloud account, and can access settings via your cloud provider as if you set up the infrastructure manually.

|  | Local | Encore Cloud | GCP / AWS / Azure |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| **Environment types:** | Development | Preview, Development | Development, Production |
| **Objectives:** | Provisioning speed | Provisioning speed, Cost\* | Reliability, Security, Scalability |

\*Encore Cloud is free to use, subject to Fair Use guidelines and usage limits. [Learn more](/docs/about/usage)

## Development Infrastructure

Encore provisions infrastructure resources differently for each type of development environment.

|  | Local | Preview / Development (Encore Cloud) | GCP / AWS / Azure |
| - | - | - | - |
| **SQL Databases:** | Docker | Encore Managed (Kubernetes) | [See production](/docs/deploy/infra#production-infrastructure) |
| **Pub/Sub:** | In-memory ([NSQ](https://nsq.io)) | GCP Pub/Sub | [See production](/docs/deploy/infra#production-infrastructure) |
| **Caches:** | In-memory (Redis) | In-memory (Redis) | [See production](/docs/deploy/infra#production-infrastructure) |
| **Cron Jobs:** | Disabled | [Encore Managed][encore-cron] | [See production](/docs/deploy/infra#production-infrastructure) |

### Local Development

For local development Encore provisions a combination of Docker and in-memory infrastructure components.
[SQL Databases][encore-sqldb] are provisioned using [Docker](https://docker.com). For [Pub/Sub][encore-pubsub]
and [Caching][encore-caching] the infrastructure is run in-memory. 

When running tests, a separate SQL Database cluster is provisioned that is optimized for high performance
(using an in-memory filesystem and fsync disabled) at the expense of reduced reliability.

To avoid surprises during development, [Cron Jobs][encore-cron] are not triggered in local environments.
They can always be triggered manually by calling the API directly from the [development dashboard](/docs/observability/dev-dash).

The application code itself is compiled and run natively on your machine (without Docker).

### Preview Environments

When you've [connected your application to GitHub](/docs/how-to/github), Encore automatically provisions a temporary [Preview Environment](/docs/deploy/environments#preview-environments) for each Pull Request.

Preview Environments are created in Encore Cloud, and are optimized for provisioning speed and cost-effectiveness.
The Preview Environment is automatically destroyed when the Pull Request is merged or closed.

Preview Environments are named after the pull request, so PR #72 will create an environment named `pr:72`.

### Encore Cloud

Encore Cloud is a simple, zero-configuration hosting solution provided by Encore.
It's perfect for development environments and small-scale hobby use.
It's also a great way to evaluate Encore without having to connect your cloud account.

Encore Cloud is not designed for production use and does not offer reliability guarantees for persistent storage
like SQL Databases. Other infrastructure primitives like [Pub/Sub][encore-pubsub] and [Caching][encore-caching]
are provisioned with small-scale use in mind.

## Production Infrastructure

Encore provisions production infrastructure resources using best-practice guidelines and services for each respective cloud provider.

|  | GCP | AWS | Azure |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Networking:** | [VPC](#google-cloud-platform-gcp) | [VPC](#amazon-web-services-aws) | [VPC](#microsoft-azure) |
| **Compute:** | [Cloud Run](#google-cloud-platform-gcp) | [Fargate ECS](#amazon-web-services-aws) | [App Service](#microsoft-azure) & [App Service Plan](#microsoft-azure) |
| **SQL Databases:** | [GCP Cloud SQL](#sql-databases) | [Amazon RDS](#sql-databases-1) | [Azure Database](#sql-databases-2) |
| **Pub/Sub:** | [GCP Pub/Sub](#pubsub) | [Amazon SQS][aws-sqs] & [Amazon SNS](#pubsub-1) | [Azure Service Bus](pubsub-2) |
| **Caches:** | [GCP Memorystore (Redis)](#caching) | [Amazon ElastiCache (Redis)](#caching-1) | [Azure Cache (Redis)](#caching-2) |
| **Cron Jobs:** | [Encore Managed][encore-cron] | [Encore Managed][encore-cron] | [Encore Managed][encore-cron] |
| **Secrets:** | [Secret Manager][gcp-secrets] | [AWS Secrets Manager][aws-secrets] | [App Service App][azure-app-service-secrets] |

### Configurability

With Encore you do not define any cloud service specifics in application code. This means, after deploying to your own cloud account, you can safely use your cloud provider's console to modify the provisioned resources according to your application's scaling requirements. See more details below for each cloud provider and infrastructure resource.

In the future, Encore will provide built-in optimization of cloud environments according to your applications real-world behavior.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

[gcp-cloudsql]: https://cloud.google.com/sql
[gcp-redis]: https://cloud.google.com/memorystore

Encore provisions a single GCP Project for each environment, containing a single [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)][gcp-vpc].
Within the VPC Encore provisions a [Cloud Run][gcp-cloudrun] service to run the application, storing secret values using [Secret Manager][gcp-secrets].

#### SQL Databases
When using [SQL Databases][encore-sqldb], Encore provisions a single [GCP Cloud SQL][gcp-cloudsql] cluster, and separate databases within that cluster. The cluster is configured with the latest PostgreSQL version available at the time of provisioning.

The machine type is chosen as the smallest available that supports auto-scaling (1 vCPU / 3.75GiB memory).
You can freely increase the machine type yourself to handle larger scales.

Additionally, Encore sets up:
* Automatic daily backups (retained for 7 days) with point-in-time recovery
* Private networking, ensuring the database is only accessible from the VPC
* Mutual TLS encryption for additional security
* High availability mode with automatic failover (via disk replication to multiple zones)

#### Pub/Sub
When using [Pub/Sub][encore-pubsub], Encore provisions [GCP Pub/Sub][gcp-pubsub] topics and subscriptions. Additionally, Encore automatically creates and configures dead-letter topics.

#### Caching
When using [Caching][encore-caching], Encore provisions [GCP Memorystore for Redis][gcp-redis] clusters.

Additionally, Encore sets up:
* Redis authentication
* Transit encryption with TLS for additional security
* A 10% memory buffer to better memory fragmentation, and active defragmentation

#### Cron Jobs
When using [Cron Jobs][encore-cron], Encore Cloud triggers the execution
of cron jobs by calling the corresponding API using a signed request so the application can verify
the source of the request as coming from Encore's cron functionality. No infrastructure is
provisioned for this to work.
