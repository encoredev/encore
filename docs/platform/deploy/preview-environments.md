When using [Encore Cloud Pro](https://encore.cloud/pricing), you automatically get ephemeral Preview Environments for each Pull Request.

Preview Environments are free, fully-managed development environments that run on Encore Cloud. They let you test changes without managing infrastructure or incurring cost.

See the [infra docs](/docs/platform/infrastructure/infra#preview-environments) if you're curious about exactly how Preview Environments are provisioned.

## Using Preview Environments

To use Preview Environments, you first need to [connect your application to GitHub](/docs/platform/integrations/github).

Preview Environments are named after the pull request, for example PR #72 creates a Preview Environment named `pr:72` with the API base url `https://pr72-$APP_ID.encr.app`.

You can also view the environment in the Encore Cloud dashboard, where the url will be `https://app.encore.cloud/$APP_ID/envs/pr:72`.

## Populate databases with test data automatically

Preview Environments can automatically come with pre-populated test data thanks to Neon's database branching feature. Here's how it works:

1. Your main database (typically in staging) contains your test data
2. When a Preview Environment is created, it gets a fresh database that's an exact copy of your main database
3. This happens automatically - no manual data copying needed!

#### Setup instructions
1. Go to [Encore Cloud dashboard](https://app.encore.cloud)
2. Select your app > App Settings > Preview Environments
3. Choose which environment's database to copy from (e.g., staging)
4. Save your changes

**Note:** This feature requires using Neon as your database provider, which is:
- Default for Encore Cloud environments
- Optional for AWS and GCP environments

## Frontend Collaboration

Preview Environments make it really easy to collaborate and test changes with your frontend. Just update your frontend API client to point to the `pr:#` environment.
This is a one-line change since your API client always specifies the environment name, e.g. `https://<env>-<my-app>.encr.app/`.

If your pull request makes changes to the API, you can [generate a new API client](/docs/ts/cli/client-generation)
for the new backend API using `encore gen client --env=pr:72 --lang=typescript my-app`
