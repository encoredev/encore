# Overview

When deploying applications to your own cloud, Encore Cloud can provision all necessary infrastructureâ€”including database instances. However, if you already have a Cloud SQL instance, you can connect your Encore application directly to this existing database.

## Benefits

Using an existing Cloud SQL instance allows you to:
- Maintain data continuity with your existing systems
- Preserve specific database configurations
- Utilize familiar database setups without migration

## Importing a Cloud SQL instance

Follow these steps to import your existing Cloud SQL instance:

1. Navigate to **Create Environment** in the [Encore Cloud dashboard](https://app.encore.cloud)
2. Select the GCP cloud provider
3. Choose **Import Existing Cloud SQL Instance**
4. Add permissions for the Encore Service Account:
   - Copy the `Encore GCP Service Account` from the cloud dashboard
   - Go to your project's IAM page in the GCP Console
   - Grant the `Owner` role to the `Encore GCP Service Account`
5. Return to the Encore Cloud dashboard
6. Specify your database's `GCP Project ID` and `Cloud SQL Instance Name`
7. Click the `Resolve` button to validate the instance

Once validated, you can create the environment. When you deploy to this environment, Encore Cloud will automatically connect your application to your imported Cloud SQL instance rather than provisioning a new database.

## Mapping existing databases to your Encore app
To access an existing database in your Encore application, you need to specify the name of the existing database when you declare the database in your app. For example, if you have an existing database called `mydb` you can create a reference to it like so:

```typescript
const db = new SQLDatabase("mydb");
```

```go
sqldb.NewDatabase("mydb", sqldb.DatabaseConfig{
	Migrations: "./migrations",
})
```

## Applying migrations to existing databases
Encore uses a table called `schema_migrations` in the public namespace to keep track of which migrations have been applied. If you import an existing database without that table, Encore will create it for you and apply your migrations in order. If the table already exists, Encore expects it to contain exactly two columns:

```
version bigint
dirty boolean
```

If the table exists but has a different schema, you will not be able to import it with Encore at this time. If the table exists with an existing entry, Encore will apply all higher versions in your `migrations` directory to the database.
