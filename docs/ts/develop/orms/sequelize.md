Encore supports using [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)  with TypeScript. Sequelize is a promise-based Node.js ORM.
To use Sequelize with Encore, you need to create a new `SQLDatabase` instance and pass the connection string to Sequelize.

```ts
-- database.ts --
import {
  Model,
  InferAttributes,
  InferCreationAttributes,
  CreationOptional,
  DataTypes,
  Sequelize,
} from "sequelize";
import { SQLDatabase } from "encore.dev/storage/sqldb";

const DB = new SQLDatabase('encore_sequelize_test', {
  migrations: './migrations',
});

const sequelize = new Sequelize(DB.connectionString);

class User extends Model<InferAttributes<User>, InferCreationAttributes<User>> {
  declare id: CreationOptional<number>;
  declare name: string;
  declare surname: string;
}

const count = await User.count();
```

## Migrations
Encore does not yet support js migration files generated by e.g. `sequelize-cli model:generate`. 
Instead, you have to maintain your own [migration files](/docs/ts/primitives/databases#database-migrations) in SQL format.

```sql
-- migrations/1_create_user.up.sql --
CREATE TABLE "user" (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  surname TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

## Apply migrations
Migrations will automatically be applied when running your Encore application. You should not run `sequelize db:migrate` or similar commands.

## Tracing
Encore traces are not yet supported for Sequelize.
