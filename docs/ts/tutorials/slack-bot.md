<Callout type="info">

To make it easier to follow along, we've laid out a trail of croissants to guide your way.
Whenever you see a ü•ê it means there's something for you to do.

</Callout>

## 1. Create your Encore application

ü•ê Create a new Encore application by running `encore app create` and select `Empty app` as the template.
**Take a note of your app id, we'll need it in the next step.**

## 2. Create a Slack app

ü•ê The first step is to create a new Slack app:

1. Head over to [Slack's API site](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.
2. When prompted, choose to create the app **from an app manifest**.
3. Choose a workspace to install the app in.

ü•ê Enter the following manifest (replace `$APP_ID` in the URL below with your app id from above):

```yaml
_metadata:
  major_version: 1
display_information:
  name: Encore Bot
  description: Cowsay for the cloud age.
features:
  slash_commands:
    - command: /cowsay
      # Replace $APP_ID below
      url: https://staging-$APP_ID.encr.app/cowsay
      description: Say things with a flair!
      usage_hint: your message here
      should_escape: false
  bot_user:
    display_name: encore-bot
    always_online: true
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - commands
      - chat:write
      - chat:write.public
settings:
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

Once created, we're ready to move on with implementing our Encore endpoint!

## 3. Implement the Slack endpoint

Since Slack sends custom HTTP headers that we need to pay attention to, we're going to
use a raw endpoint in Encore. For more information on this check out Slack's documentation
on [Enabling interactivity with Slash Commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands).

ü•ê In your Encore app, create a directory named `slack` containing a file named `encore.service.ts`.

```shell
$ mkdir slack
$ touch slack/encore.service.ts
```

ü•ê Add the following code to `slack/encore.service.ts`:

```ts
-- slack/encore.service.ts --
import { Service } from "encore.dev/service";

export default new Service("slack");
```

This is how you create define services with Encore. Encore will now consider files in the `slack` directory and all its subdirectories as part of the `slack` service.

ü•ê Create a file `slack/slack.ts` with the following contents:

```ts
-- slack/slack.ts --
import { api } from "encore.dev/api";
import type { IncomingMessage } from "node:http";

// cowart is the formatting string for printing the cow art.
const cowart = (msg: string) => `Moo! ${msg}
`;

export const cowsay = api.raw(
  { expose: true, path: "/cowsay", method: "*" },
  async (req, resp) => {
    const body = await getBody(req);

    const text = new URLSearchParams(body).get("text");
    const msg = cowart(text || "Moo!");
    resp.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    resp.end(JSON.stringify({ response_type: "in_channel", text: msg }));
  },
);

// Extract the body from an incoming request.
function getBody(req: IncomingMessage): Promise<string> {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const bodyParts: any[] = [];
    req
      .on("data", (chunk) => {
        bodyParts.push(chunk);
      })
      .on("end", () => {
        resolve(Buffer.concat(bodyParts).toString());
      });
  });
}
```

Let's try it out locally.

ü•ê Start your app with `encore run` and then call it in another terminal:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/cowsay -d 'text=Eat your greens!'
{"response_type":"in_channel","text":"Moo! Eat your greens!"}
```

Looks great!

ü•ê Next, let's deploy it to the cloud:

```shell
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git push encore
```

Once deployed, we're ready to try our Slack command!

ü•ê Head over to the workspace you installed the app in and run `/cowsay Hello there`.
You should see something like this:

![Cowsay](https://encore.dev/assets/docs/cowsay-wip.png "Cowsay (Work in Progress)")

And just like that we have a fully working Slack integration.

## 4. Secure the webhook endpoint

In order to get up and running quickly we ignored one important aspect for a production-ready Slack app:
verifying that the webhook requests are actually coming from Slack. Let's do that now!

The Slack documentation covers this really well on the [Verifying requests from Slack](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack) page.

In short, what we need to do is:

1. Save a shared secret that Slack provides us
2. Use the secret to verify that the request comes from Slack, using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code).

### Save the shared secret

Let's define a secret using Encore's secrets management functionality.

ü•ê Add this to your `slack.ts` file:

```ts
HL slack/slack.ts 0:0
HL slack/slack.ts 2:2
-- slack/slack.ts --
import { secret } from "encore.dev/config";

const slackSigningSecret = secret("SlackSigningSecret");
```

ü•ê Head over to the configuration section for your Slack app (go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) &rarr; select your app &rarr; Basic Information).

ü•ê Copy the **Signing Secret** and then run `encore secret set --type prod SlackSigningSecret` and paste the secret.

ü•ê For development you will also want to set `encore secret set --type dev,local,pr SlackSigningSecret`.
You can use the same secret value or a placeholder value.

### Compute the HMAC

TypeScript makes computing HMAC very straightforward, but it's still a fair amount of code.

ü•ê Add a few more imports to your file, so that it reads:
```ts
-- slack/slack.ts --
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "node:crypto";
import type { IncomingHttpHeaders } from "http";
```

ü•ê Next, we'll add the `verifySignature` function:

```ts
-- slack/slack.ts --
// Verifies the signature of an incoming request from Slack.
const verifySignature = async function (
  body: string,
  headers: IncomingHttpHeaders,
) {
  const requestTimestampSec = parseInt(
    headers["x-slack-request-timestamp"] as string,
  );
  const signature = headers["x-slack-signature"] as string;
  if (Number.isNaN(requestTimestampSec)) {
    throw new Error(
      `Failed to verify authenticity: header x-slack-request-timestamp did not have the expected type (${requestTimestampSec})`,
    );
  }

  // Calculate time-dependent values
  const nowMs = Date.now();
  const requestTimestampMaxDeltaMin = 5;
  const fiveMinutesAgoSec =
    Math.floor(nowMs / 1000) - 60 * requestTimestampMaxDeltaMin;

  // Enforce verification rules

  // Rule 1: Check staleness
  if (requestTimestampSec < fiveMinutesAgoSec) {
    throw new Error(
      `Failed to verify authenticity: x-slack-request-timestamp must differ from system time by no more than ${requestTimestampMaxDeltaMin} minutes or request is stale`,
    );
  }

  // Rule 2: Check signature
  // Separate parts of signature
  const [signatureVersion, signatureHash] = signature.split("=");
  // Only handle known versions
  if (signatureVersion !== "v0") {
    throw new Error(`Failed to verify authenticity: unknown signature version`);
  }
  // Compute our own signature hash
  const hmac = createHmac("sha256", slackSigningSecret());
  hmac.update(`${signatureVersion}:${requestTimestampSec}:${body}`);
  const ourSignatureHash = hmac.digest("hex");
  if (
    !signatureHash ||
    !timingSafeEqual(
      Buffer.from(signatureHash, "utf8"),
      Buffer.from(ourSignatureHash, "utf8"),
    )
  ) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to verify authenticity: signature mismatch`);
  }
};
```

We're now ready to verify the signature.

ü•ê Update the `cowsay` function to look like this:

```ts
HL slack/slack.ts 5:12
-- slack/slack.ts --
export const cowsay = api.raw(
  { expose: true, path: "/cowsay", method: "*" },
  async (req, resp) => {
    const body = await getBody(req);

    try {
      await verifySignature(body, req.headers);
    } catch (err) {
      const e = err as Error;
      resp.statusCode = 500;
      resp.end(e.message);
      return;
    }

    const text = new URLSearchParams(body).get("text");
    const msg = cowart(text || "Moo!");
    resp.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json");
    resp.end(JSON.stringify({ response_type: "in_channel", text: msg }));
  },
);
```

## 5. Put it all together and deploy

Finally we're ready to put it all together.

ü•ê Add the `cowart` in `slack.ts` like so:

```ts
-- slack/slack.ts --
const cowart = (msg: string) => `
\`\`\`
+-${"-".repeat(msg.length)}-+
| ${msg} |
+-${"-".repeat(msg.length)}-+
      \\  __n__n__
  .------\`-\\00/-'
 /  ##  ## (oo)
/ \\## __   ./
   |//YY \\|/
   |||   |||
\`\`\`
`;
```

ü•ê Finally, let's commit our changes and deploy it:

```shell
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m 'Verify webhook requests and improve art'
$ git push encore
```

ü•ê Once deployed, head back to Slack and run `/cowsay Hello there`.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see:

![Slack Cowsay](https://encore.dev/assets/docs/cowsay.png "Slack bot")

And there we go, a production-ready Slack bot in less than 100 lines of code.

Well done!

### Celebrate with fireworks

Now that your app is running in the cloud, let's celebrate with some fireworks:

ü•ê In the Cloud Dashboard, open the Command Menu by pressing **Cmd + K** (Mac) or **Ctrl + K** (Windows/Linux).

_From here you can easily access all Cloud Dashboard features and for example jump straight to specific services in the Service Catalog or view Traces for specific endpoints._

ü•ê Type `fireworks` in the Command Menu and press enter. Sit back and enjoy the show!
