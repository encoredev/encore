To make it easier to follow along, we've laid out a trail of croissants to guide your way.
Whenever you see a ü•ê it means there's something for you to do.

</Callout>

## 1. Create a service and endpoint

Create a new application by running `encore app create` and select `Empty app` as the template.

If this is the first time you're using Encore, you'll be asked if you wish to create a free account.
This is needed when you want Encore to manage functionality like secrets and handle cloud deployments (which we'll use later on in the tutorial).

Now let's create a new `url` service.

ü•ê In your application's root folder, create a directory named `url` containing a file named `encore.service.ts`.

```shell
$ mkdir url
$ touch url/encore.service.ts
```

ü•ê Add the following code to `url/encore.service.ts`:

```ts
-- url/encore.service.ts --
import { Service } from "encore.dev/service";

export default new Service("url");
```

This is how you define a service with Encore. Encore will now consider files in the `url` directory and all its subdirectories as part of the `url` service.


ü•ê Create a new file `url.ts` in the `url` directory that looks like this:

```ts
-- url/url.ts --
import { api } from "encore.dev/api";
import { randomBytes } from "node:crypto";

interface URL {
  id: string; // short-form URL id
  url: string; // complete URL, in long form
}

interface ShortenParams {
  url: string; // the URL to shorten
}

// Shortens a URL.
export const shorten = api(
  { method: "POST", path: "/url", expose: true },
  async ({ url }: ShortenParams): Promise<URL> => {
    const id = randomBytes(6).toString("base64url");
    return { id, url };
  },
);
```

This sets up the `POST /url` endpoint.

ü•ê Let‚Äôs see if it works! Start your app by running `encore run`.

You should see this:

```output
Encore development server running!

Your API is running at:     http://127.0.0.1:4000
Development Dashboard URL:  http://localhost:9400/5g288
3:50PM INF registered API endpoint endpoint=shorten path=/url service=url
```

ü•ê Next, call your endpoint from the Local Development Dashboard at [http://localhost:9400](http://localhost:9400) and view a trace of the response.
It should look like this:

<video autoPlay playsInline loop controls muted className="w-full h-full">
  <source src="/assets/docs/rest_tut.mp4" className="w-full h-full" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

You can also call it from the terminal:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url -d '{"url": "https://encore.dev"}'
```

You should see this:

```output
{
  "id": "5cJpBVRp",
  "url": "https://encore.dev"
}
```

It works! There‚Äôs just one problem...

Right now, we‚Äôre not actually storing the URL anywhere. That means we can generate shortened IDs but there‚Äôs no way to get back to the original URL! We need to store a mapping from the short ID to the complete URL.

## 2. Save URLs in a database
Fortunately, Encore makes it really easy to set up a PostgreSQL database to store our data. To do so, we first define a **database schema**, in the form of a migration file.

ü•ê Create a new folder named `migrations` inside the `url` folder. Then, inside the `migrations` folder, create an initial database migration file named `1_create_tables.up.sql`. The file name format is important (it must start with `1_` and end in `.up.sql`).

ü•ê Add the following contents to the file:

```sql
CREATE TABLE url (
	id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
	original_url TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

ü•ê Next, go back to the `url/url.ts` file and import the `SQLDatabase` class from `encore.dev/storage/sqldb` module by modifying the imports to look like this:

```ts
import { api } from "encore.dev/api";
import { SQLDatabase } from "encore.dev/storage/sqldb";
import { randomBytes } from "node:crypto";
```

ü•ê Now, to insert data into our database, let‚Äôs create an instance of the `SQLDatabase` class:

```ts
const db = new SQLDatabase("url", { migrations: "./migrations" });
```

ü•ê Lastly, we can update our `shorten` function to insert into the database:

```ts
export const shorten = api(
  { method: "POST", path: "/url", expose: true },
  async ({ url }: ShortenParams): Promise<URL> => {
    const id = randomBytes(6).toString("base64url");
    await db.exec`
      INSERT INTO url (id, original_url)
      VALUES (${id}, ${url})
    `;
    return { id, url };
  },
);
```

<Callout type="info">

Before running your application, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running. It's required to locally run Encore applications with databases.

</Callout>

ü•ê Next, start the application again with `encore run` and Encore automatically sets up your database.

(In case your application won't run, check the [databases troubleshooting guide](/docs/ts/primitives/databases#troubleshooting).)

You can verify that the database was created by looking at your application's Flow architecture diagram in the local development dashboard at [localhost:9400](http://localhost:9400), which should look like this:

<video autoPlay playsInline loop controls muted className="w-full h-full">
  <source src="/assets/docs/rest_tut_2.mp4" className="w-full h-full" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

ü•ê Now let's call the API again from the local development dashboard, or from the terminal:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url -d '{"url": "https://encore.dev"}'
```

ü•ê Finally, let's verify that it was saved in the database. You can do this by checking the trace in the local development dashboard, or you can run  `encore db shell url` from the app root directory and inputting `select * from url;`:

```shell
$ encore db shell url
psql (13.1, server 11.12)
Type "help" for help.

url=# select * from url;
    id    |    original_url
----------+--------------------
 zr6RmZc4 | https://encore.dev
(1 row)
```

That was easy!

## 3. Add endpoint to retrieve URLs
To complete our URL shortener API, let‚Äôs add the endpoint to retrieve a URL given its short id.

ü•ê Add this endpoint to `url/url.ts`:

```ts
import { APIError } from "encore.dev/api";

export const get = api(
  { method: "GET", path: "/url/:id", expose: true },
  async ({ id }: { id: string }): Promise<URL> => {
    const row = await db.queryRow`
      SELECT original_url FROM url WHERE id = ${id}
    `;
    if (!row) throw APIError.notFound("url not found");
    return { id, url: row.original_url };
  },
);
```

Encore uses the `/url/:id` syntax to represent a path with a parameter. The `id` name corresponds to the parameter name in the function signature. In this case it is of type `string`, but you can also use other built-in types like `number` or `boolean` if you want to restrict the values.

ü•ê We can make sure it works by reviewing the endpoint in the [Service Catalog](/docs/ts/observability/service-catalog) in the local development dashboard, where we can call it using the `id` you got in the previous step:

<video autoPlay playsInline loop controls muted className="w-full h-full">
  <source src="/assets/docs/rest_tut_3.mp4" className="w-full h-full" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

You can also call it directly from the terminal:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url/zr6RmZc4
```

You should now see this:

```json
{
  "id": "zr6RmZc4",
  "url": "https://encore.dev"
}
```

It works! That's how you build REST APIs and use PostgreSQL databases in Encore.

## 4. Add a test

Before deployment, it is good practice to have tests to assure that the service works properly. Such tests including database access are easy to write.

ü•ê Let's start by adding the `vitest` package to your project:

```shell
$ npm i --save-dev vitest
```

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a testing framework that works great with Encore but you can use another TypeScript testing framework if you like.

ü•ê Next we need to add a test script to our `package.json`:

```json
...
"scripts": {
  "test": "vitest"
},
...
```

We've prepared a test to check that the whole cycle of shortening the URL, storing and then retrieving the original URL works. It looks like this:

```ts
import { describe, expect, test } from "vitest";
import { get, shorten } from "./url";

describe("shorten", () => {
  test("getting a shortened url should give back the original", async () => {
    const resp = await shorten({ url: "https://example.com" });
    const url = await get({ id: resp.id });
    expect(url.url).toBe("https://example.com");
  });
});
```

ü•ê Save this in a separate file `url/url.test.ts`.

ü•ê Now run `encore test` to verify that it's working.

If you use the local development dashboard ([localhost:9400](http://localhost:9400)), you can even see traces for tests.

## 5. Deploy to the cloud

The final step before you deploy is to commit all changes to the project repo.

ü•ê Commit the new files to the project's git repo and trigger a deploy to Encore's free development cloud by running:

```shell
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git push encore
```

Encore will now build and test your app, provision the needed infrastructure, and deploy your application to the cloud.

After triggering the deployment, you will see a URL where you can view its progress in Encore's [Cloud Dashboard](https://app.encore.dev). It will look something like: `https://app.encore.dev/$APP_ID/deploys/...`

<video autoPlay playsInline loop controls muted className="w-full h-full">
  <source src="/assets/docs/rest_tut_4.mp4" className="w-full h-full" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

From there you can also see metrics, traces, and connect your own AWS or GCP account to use for production deployment.

*Now you have a fully fledged backend running in the cloud, well done!*

### Celebrate with fireworks

Now that your app is running in the cloud, let's celebrate with some fireworks:

ü•ê In the Cloud Dashboard, open the Command Menu by pressing **Cmd + K** (Mac) or **Ctrl + K** (Windows/Linux).

_From here you can easily access all Cloud Dashboard features and for example jump straight to specific services in the Service Catalog or view Traces for specific endpoints._

ü•ê Type `fireworks` in the Command Menu and press enter. Sit back and enjoy the show!

## What's next

Now that you know how to build a backend with a database, you're ready to let your creativity flow and begin building your next great idea!

ü•ê A great next step is to [integrate with GitHub](/docs/platform/integrations/github). Once you've linked with GitHub, Encore will automatically start building and running tests against your Pull Requests.

We're excited to hear what you're going to build with Encore, join the pioneering developer community on [Discord](/discord) and share your story.
