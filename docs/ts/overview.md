Modern backend applications rely on a common set of infrastructure primitives for most of the behavior. To improve your development workflow, Encore.ts enables you to declare these primitives as type-safe objects in application code. Encore.ts then takes care of running your local environments, provides observability and documentation, and helps you [integrate with cloud infrastructure](/docs/deploy/infra). Encore also offers a [Cloud Platform](/use-cases/devops-automation) which fully automates infrastructure and DevOps for your cloud on AWS/GCP.
