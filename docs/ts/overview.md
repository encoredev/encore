Encore.ts simplifies backend development by providing an application-centric way of using most common infrastructure primitives, things like: databases, queues, cron jobs, and APIs.
It lets you define these primitives as type-safe objects directly in your application code. This approach streamlines your development process in several ways:

1. Local Environment Management: Encore.ts automatically handles the setup and running of your local development environments.

2. Enhanced Observability: It provides [built-in tools](/docs/observability/dev-dash) for monitoring and understanding your application's behavior.

3. Automatic Documentation: Encore.ts generates and maintains [up-to-date documentation](/docs/develop/api-docs) for your APIs and services.

4. Cloud Integration: It simplifies and facilitates [integrating with cloud infrastructure](/docs/how-to/self-host), making deployment and scaling easier.

5. DevOps Automation: For those seeking a fully automated solution, Encore offers an optional [Cloud Platform](/use-cases/devops-automation) that automates infrastructure provisioning, IAM management, and DevOps processes on AWS and GCP.

By combining these features, Encore.ts enables you to focus on writing your application logic while it automates much of the complexities of modern backend development.
