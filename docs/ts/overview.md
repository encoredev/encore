Modern backend applications rely on a common set of infrastructure primitives for most of the behavior. To improve your development workflow, Encore's Backend SDK lets you declare these primitives as type-safe objects in application code. Encore then takes care of running your local environment, providing tools for observability and testing, and [orchestrating cloud infrastructure](/docs/deploy/infra) and deploying to your cloud on AWS/GCP.

**See how to use each primitive:**
- [Services and APIs](/docs/ts/primitives/services-and-apis)
- [Databases](/docs/ts/primitives/databases)
- [Cron Jobs](/docs/ts/primitives/cron-jobs)
- [Pub/Sub & Queues](/docs/ts/primitives/pubsub)
- [Secrets](/docs/ts/primitives/secrets)

Check out the [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials) section for examples of complete Encore applications.
