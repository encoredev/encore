Modern backend applications rely on a common set of infrastructure primitives for most of the behavior. To improve your development workflow, Encore's Backend SDK lets you declare these primitives as type-safe objects in application code. Encore then takes care of running your local environment, providing tools for observability and testing, and [orchestrating cloud infrastructure](/docs/deploy/infra) and deploying to your cloud on AWS/GCP.
