Encore makes it easy to create API endpoints that can stream data to and from your applications.

## Different kinds of stream

Encore supports three different kinds of streams that you can use depending on in which direction your data flows:
- **OutStream**: When you need to stream data out from your service.
- **InStream**: When you need to stream data into your service.
- **BidiStream**: When you need to stream data into and out from service.

## How it works

When you connect to a stream API endpoint, the client and server will do a handshake in the form of a http request. If the server accepts the handshake request, a stream is returned to the client and to the API handler. Under the hood the stream is a websocket that can be used to send and receive messages over.

Path parameters, query parameters and headers can be passed via the handshake request. The stream returned to the client and to the API handler are typed with the incoming and outgoing message types that you specify in your api.

## Defining stream APIs

Similar to how you can setup RESTful API endpoints with Encore, you can also easily setup type-safe stream API endpoints. They accept a handshake type, an incoming and an outgoing message type (depending on you chooise of stream direction).

If you don't need any data from the handshake, you can ignore that type, and only specify the incoming and outgoing message types.

For example, if you want to have a stream of messages from server to client for a specific chat room, you could setup an `api.streamOut`:

```typescript
interface Handshake {
  roomId: string;
}

interface Message {
  text: string;
  sender: string;
}

// messageStream streams out all chat messages for a certain id
export const messageStream = api.streamOut<Handshake, Message>(
  { path: "/chat/:roomId" },
  async (handshake, stream) {
    // Use `handshake.roomId` to fetch messages
    for await (const msg of messages) {
      await stream.send(msg);
    }
  }
);
```

Or if you want to have a stream from client to server, you can set it up with `api.streamIn`:

```typescript
interface DataChunk {
  // ...
}

export const uploadStream = api.streamIn<DataChunk>(
  { path: "/upload" },
  async (stream) {
    for await (const data of stream) {
      // do something with data
    }
  }
);
```

Finally if you want to stream messages in both directions, you should use `api.streamBidi`:

```typescript
interface PingMessage {
  // ...
}

interface PongMessage {
  // ...
}

export const pingpongStream = api.streamBidi<PingMessage, PongMessage>(
  { path: "/pingpong" },
  async (stream) {
    for await (const ping of stream) {
      // do something with the ping payload
      await stream.send({ /* ... */ })
    }
  }
);
```

The type parameters you need to specify depends on the kind of stream you are using, for a bidi stream you'll need to specify an incoming and outgoing type, while for the other you need to specify either the incomin or outgoing type depending on the direction of the stream. For incoming stream endpoints you can also specify a optional outgoing type if your api handler responds with some data when it is done with the incoming stream.

For all stream types the handshake type is optional, and only needs to be used whenever you need data from the initial request, such as path parameters, query parameters or headers.

These are all the different variations that you can use when defining you stream APIs:

- `api.streamBidi<Handshake, Incoming, Outgoing>({ ... }, async (handshake, stream) {})`
- `api.streamBidi<Incoming, Outgoing>({ ... }, async (stream) {})`
- `api.streamIn<Handshake, Incoming, Outgoing>({ ... }, async (handshake, stream): Promise<Outgoing> {})`
- `api.streamIn<Handshake, Incoming>({ ... }, async (handshake, stream) {})`
- `api.streamIn<Incoming, Outgoing>({ ... }, async (stream): Promise<Outgoing> {})`
- `api.streamIn<Incoming>({ ... }, async (stream) {})`
- `api.streamOut<Handshake, Outgoing>({ ... }, async (handshake, stream) {})`
- `api.streamOut<Outgoing>({ ... }, async (stream) {})`

The type parameters are required for encore to understand your api, we currently do not support inferring the types from the handler functions types.

In your handler you get a stream class, it is an async iterator for incoming messages, and have an async `send` method for sending data out.

The same goes for the generated client, when you call the stream endpoint you will get a stream class returned that implements an async iterator for messages sent to the client, and an async `send` method for sending data to the server.

## Requiring authentication

You can use `authHandler` the same way you do for all your regular endpoints, just specify `auth: true` in you endpoint options. You can get the auth data in your handler by calling `getAuthData()`.
