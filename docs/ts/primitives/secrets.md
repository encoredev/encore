Wouldn't it be nice to store secret values like API keys, database passwords, and private keys directly in the source code?
Of course, we canâ€™t do that &ndash; it's horrifyingly insecure!
(Unfortunately, it's also [very common](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/how-bad-can-it-git-characterizing-secret-leakage-in-public-github-repositories/).)

Encore's built-in secrets manager makes it simple to store secrets in a secure way and lets you use them in your program like regular variables.

## Using secrets in your application

To use a secret in your application, define a top-level variable directly in your code by calling the `secret` function from `encore.dev/config`.

For example:

```ts
import { secret } from "encore.dev/config";

// Personal access token for deployments
const githubToken = secret("GitHubAPIToken");
```

When you've defined a secret in your program, the Encore compiler will check that they are set before running or deploying your application.

When running your application locally, if a secret is not set, you will get a warning notifying you that a secret value is missing.

When deploying to a cloud environment, all secrets must be defined, otherwise the deploy will fail.

Once you've provided values for all secrets, you can just use them in your application like a regular variable. For example:

```ts
async function callGitHub() {
    const resp = await fetch("https:///api.github.com/user", {
        credentials: "include",
        headers: {
            Authorization: `token ${githubToken}`,
        }
    });
    // ... handle resp
}
```

Secret keys are globally unique for your whole application. If multiple services use the same secret name they both receive the same secret value at runtime.

## Storing secret values

### Using the Cloud Dashboard

The simplest way to set up secrets is with the Secrets Manager in the Encore Cloud Dashboard. Open your app in [app.encore.dev](https://app.encore.dev), go to **Settings** in the main navigation, and then click on **Secrets** in the settings menu.

From here you can create secrets, save secret values, and configure different values for different environments.

### Using the CLI

If you prefer, you can also set up secrets from the CLI using:<br/> `encore secret set --type <types> <secret-name>`

`<types>` defines which environment types the secret value applies to. Use a comma-separated list of `production`, `development`, `preview`, and `local`. Shorthands: `prod`, `dev`, `pr`.

For example `encore secret set --type prod SSHPrivateKey` sets the secret value for production environments,<br/> and `encore secret set --type dev,preview,local GitHubAPIToken` sets the secret value for development, preview, and local environments.

In some cases, it can be useful to define a secret for a specific environment instead of an environment type.
You can do so with `encore secret set --env <env-name> <secret-name>`. Secret values for specific environments
take precedence over values for environment types.

### Environment settings

Each secret can only have one secret value for each environment type. For example: If you have a secret value that's shared between `development`, `preview` and `local`, and you want to override the value for `local`, you must first edit the existing secret and remove `local` using the Secrets Manager in the [Cloud Dashboard](https://app.encore.dev). You can then add a new secret value for `local`. The end result should look something like the picture below.

## How it works: Where secrets are stored

When you store a secret Encore stores it encrypted using Google Cloud Platform's [Key Management Service](https://cloud.google.com/security-key-management) (KMS).

- **Production / Your own cloud:** When you deploy to production using your own cloud account on GCP or AWS, Encore provisions a secrets manager in your account (using either KMS or AWS Secrets Manager) and replicates your secrets to it. The secrets are then injected into the container using secret environment variables.
- **Local:** For local secrets Encore automatically replicates them to developers' machines when running `encore run`.
- **Development / Encore Cloud:** Environments on Encore's development cloud (running on GCP under the hood) work the same as self-hosted GCP environments, using GCP Secrets Manager.

### Overriding local secrets

When setting secrets via the `encore secret set` command, they are automatically synced to all developers
working on the same application, courtesy of the Encore Platform.

In some cases, however, you want to override a secret only for your local machine.
This can be done by creating a file named `.secrets.local.cue` in the root of your Encore application,
next to the `encore.app` file.

The file contains key-value pairs of secret names to secret values. For example:

```cue
GitHubAPIToken: "my-local-override-token"
SSHPrivateKey: "custom-ssh-private-key"
```
