Calling an API endpoint looks like a regular function call with Encore.ts. To call an endpoint you first need to import the service from `~encore/clients` and then call the API endpoint like a regular function.
When compiling your application, Encore uses [static analysis](/docs/introduction#meet-the-encore-application-model) to parse all APIs and make then available through the `~encore/clients` module for internal calls.

In the example below, we import the service `hello` and call the `ping` endpoint using a function call to `hello.ping`.

```typescript
import { hello } from "~encore/clients"; // import 'hello' service

export const myOtherAPI = api({}, async (): Promise<void> => {
  const resp = await hello.ping({ name: "World" });
  console.log(resp.message); // "Hello World!"
});
```

This means your development workflow is as simple as building a monolith, even if you use multiple services.
You get all the benefits of function calls, like compile-time checking of all the parameters and auto-completion in your editor, while still allowing the division of code into logical components, services, and systems.
