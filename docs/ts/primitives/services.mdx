Encore.ts makes it simple to build applications with one or many services, without needing to manually handle the typical complexity of developing microservices.

## Defining services

To create an Encore service, add a file named `encore.service.ts` in a directory.

The file must export a service instance, by calling `new Service`, imported from `encore.dev/service`.

For example:

```ts

import { Service } from "encore.dev/service";

export default new Service("my-service");
```

That's it! Encore will consider this directory and all its subdirectories as part of the service.

With multiple services, each service lives in its own directory with its own `encore.service.ts`:

```
/my-app
├── package.json
├── encore.app
│
├── hello                      // hello service
│   ├── encore.service.ts
│   └── hello.ts
│
└── world                      // world service
    ├── encore.service.ts
    └── world.ts
```
