Encore.ts makes it simple to build applications with one or many services, without needing to manually handle the typical complexity of developing microservices.

## Defining services

To create an Encore service, add a file named `encore.service.ts` in a directory.

The file must export a service instance, by calling `new Service`, imported from `encore.dev/service`.

For example:

```ts

import { Service } from "encore.dev/service";

export default new Service("my-service");
```

That's it! Encore will consider this directory and all its subdirectories as part of the service.

For more on how to structure your application, see the [app structure guide](/docs/ts/develop/app-structure).
