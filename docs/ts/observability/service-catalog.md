All developers agree API documentation is great to have, but the effort of maintaining it inevitably leads to docs becoming stale and out of date.

To solve this, Encore uses the [Encore Application Model](/docs/ts/concepts/application-model) to automatically generate a Service Catalog along with complete documentation for all APIs. This ensures docs are always up-to-date as your APIs evolve.

The API docs are available both in your [Local Development Dashboard](/docs/ts/observability/dev-dash) and for your whole team in the [Encore Cloud dashboard](https://app.encore.cloud).
