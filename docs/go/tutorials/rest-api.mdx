<Callout type="info">

To make it easier to follow along, we've laid out a trail of croissants to guide your way.
Whenever you see a ü•ê it means there's something for you to do.

</Callout>

## 1. Create a service and endpoint

If you haven't already, create a new application by running `encore app create` and select `Empty app` as the template.

If this is the first time you're using Encore, you'll be asked if you wish to create a free account.
This is needed when you want Encore to manage functionality like secrets and handle cloud deployments (which we'll use later on in the tutorial).

Now let's create a new `url` service.

ü•ê In your application's root folder, create a new folder `url` and create a new file `url.go` that looks like this:

```go
-- url/url.go --
// Service url takes URLs, generates random short IDs, and stores the URLs in a database.
package url

import (
	"context"
	"crypto/rand"
	"encoding/base64"
)

type URL struct {
	ID  string // short-form URL id
	URL string // complete URL, in long form
}

type ShortenParams struct {
	URL string // the URL to shorten
}

// Shorten shortens a URL.
//encore:api public method=POST path=/url
func Shorten(ctx context.Context, p *ShortenParams) (*URL, error) {
	id, err := generateID()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return &URL{ID: id, URL: p.URL}, nil
}

// generateID generates a random short ID.
func generateID() (string, error) {
	var data [6]byte // 6 bytes of entropy
	if _, err := rand.Read(data[:]); err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	return base64.RawURLEncoding.EncodeToString(data[:]), nil
}
```

This sets up the `POST /url` endpoint (see the `//encore:api` annotation on the `Shorten` function).

ü•ê Let‚Äôs see if it works! Start your app by running `encore run`.

You should see this:

```output
Your API is running at:     http://localhost:4000
Development Dashboard URL:  http://localhost:9400
4:19PM INF registered endpoint path=/url service=url endpoint=Shorten
```

ü•ê Next, call your endpoint from the Local Development Dashboard at [http://localhost:9400](http://localhost:9400) and view a trace of the response.
It should look like this:

<video autoPlay playsInline loop controls muted className="w-full h-full">
  <source src="/assets/docs/rest_tut.mp4" className="w-full h-full" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

You can also call it from the terminal:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url -d '{"URL": "https://encore.dev"}'
```

And you should see this:

```json
{
  "ID": "5cJpBVRp",
  "URL": "https://encore.dev"
}
```

It works! There‚Äôs just one problem...

Right now, we‚Äôre not actually storing the URL anywhere. That means we can generate shortened IDs but there‚Äôs no way to get back to the original URL! We need to store a mapping from the short ID to the complete URL.

## 2. Save URLs in a database
Fortunately, Encore makes it really easy to set up a PostgreSQL database to store our data. To do so, we first define a **database schema**, in the form of a migration file.

ü•ê Create a new folder named `migrations` inside the `url` folder. Then, inside the `migrations` folder, create an initial database migration file named `1_create_tables.up.sql`. The file name format is important (it must start with `1_` and end in `.up.sql`).

ü•ê Add the following contents to the file:

```sql
-- url/migrations/1_create_tables.up.sql --
CREATE TABLE url (
	id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
	original_url TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

ü•ê Next, go back to the `url/url.go` file and import the `encore.dev/storage/sqldb` package by modifying the import statement to become:

```go
HL url/url.go 5:5
-- url/url.go --
import (
	"context"
	"crypto/rand"
	"encoding/base64"

	"encore.dev/storage/sqldb"
)
```

ü•ê Then let's define our database object by adding the following to `url/url.go`:

```go
-- url/url.go --
// Define a database named 'url', using the database
// migrations in the "./migrations" folder.

var db = sqldb.NewDatabase("url", sqldb.DatabaseConfig{
	Migrations: "./migrations",
})
```

ü•ê Now, to insert data into our database, let‚Äôs create a helper function `insert`:

```go
-- url/url.go --
// insert inserts a URL into the database.
func insert(ctx context.Context, id, url string) error {
	_, err := db.Exec(ctx, `
        INSERT INTO url (id, original_url)
        VALUES ($1, $2)
    `, id, url)
	return err
}
```

ü•ê Lastly, we can update our `Shorten` function to insert into the database:

```go
-- url/url.go --
func Shorten(ctx context.Context, p *ShortenParams) (*URL, error) {
	id, err := generateID()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	} else if err := insert(ctx, id, p.URL); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return &URL{ID: id, URL: p.URL}, nil
}
```

<Callout type="info">

Before running your application, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running. It's required to locally run Encore applications with databases.

</Callout>

ü•ê Next, start the application again with `encore run` and Encore automatically sets up your database.

(In case your application won't run, check the [databases troubleshooting guide](/docs/develop/databases#troubleshooting).)

You can verify that the database was created by opening the **Infra** tab in the local development dashboard at [localhost:9400](http://localhost:9400), which should something like this:

<img src="/assets/docs/infra_tab.png" alt="Infra tab in local development dashboard" className="w-full h-full" />

ü•ê Now let's call the API again from the local development dashboard, or from the terminal:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url -d '{"URL": "https://encore.dev"}'
```

ü•ê Finally, let's verify that it was saved in the database. You can do this by checking the trace in the local development dashboard, or you can run  `encore db shell url` from the app root directory and inputting `select * from url;`:

```shell
$ encore db shell url
psql (13.1, server 11.12)
Type "help" for help.

url=# select * from url;
    id    |    original_url
----------+--------------------
 zr6RmZc4 | https://encore.dev
(1 row)
```

That was easy!

## 3. Add endpoint to retrieve URLs
To complete our URL shortener API, let‚Äôs add the endpoint to retrieve a URL given its short id.

ü•ê Add this endpoint to `url/url.go`:

```go
-- url/url.go --
// Get retrieves the original URL for the id.
//encore:api public method=GET path=/url/:id
func Get(ctx context.Context, id string) (*URL, error) {
	u := &URL{ID: id}
	err := db.QueryRow(ctx, `
        SELECT original_url FROM url
        WHERE id = $1
    `, id).Scan(&u.URL)
	return u, err
}
```

Encore uses the `path=/url/:id` syntax to represent a path with a parameter. The `id` name corresponds to the parameter name in the function signature. In this case it is of type `string`, but you can also use other built-in types like `int` or `bool` if you want to restrict the values.

ü•ê We can make sure it works by reviewing the endpoint in the Service Catalog in the local development dashboard, where we can call it using the `id` you got in the previous step:

<video autoPlay playsInline loop controls muted className="w-full h-full">
  <source src="/assets/docs/rest_tut_3.mp4" className="w-full h-full" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

You can also call it directly from the terminal:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url/zr6RmZc4
```

You should now see this:

```json
{
  "ID": "zr6RmZc4",
  "URL": "https://encore.dev"
}
```

It works! That's how you build REST APIs and use PostgreSQL databases in Encore.

## 4. Add a test

Before deployment, it is good practice to have tests to assure that
the service works properly. Such tests including database access
are easy to write.

We've prepared a test to check that the whole cycle of shortening
the URL, storing and then retrieving the original URL works.

ü•ê Save this in a separate file `url/url_test.go`.

```go
-- url/url_test.go --
package url

import (
	"context"
	"testing"
)

// TestShortenAndRetrieve - test that the shortened URL is stored and retrieved from database.
func TestShortenAndRetrieve(t *testing.T) {
	testURL := "https://github.com/encoredev/encore"
	sp := ShortenParams{URL: testURL}
	resp, err := Shorten(context.Background(), &sp)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}
	wantURL := testURL
	if resp.URL != wantURL {
		t.Errorf("got %q, want %q", resp.URL, wantURL)
	}

	firstURL := resp
	gotURL, err := Get(context.Background(), firstURL.ID)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}
	if *gotURL != *firstURL {
		t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", *gotURL, *firstURL)
	}
}
```

ü•ê Now run `encore test ./...` to verify that it's working.

If you use the local development dashboard ([localhost:9400](http://localhost:9400)), you can even see traces for tests.

## 5. Deploy

<Accordion>

### Self-hosting

Encore supports building Docker images directly from the CLI, which can then be self-hosted on your own infrastructure of choice.

If your app is using infrastructure resources, such as SQL databases, Pub/Sub, or metrics, you will need to configure your Docker image with the necessary configuration.
Our URL shortener makes use of a PostgreSQL database, so we'll need to supply a [runtime configuration](/docs/go/self-host/configure-infra) so that our app knows how to connect to the database in the cloud.

ü•ê Create a new file `infra-config.json` in the root of your project with the following contents:

```json
{
   "$schema": "https://encore.dev/schemas/infra.schema.json",
   "sql_servers": [
      {
         "host": "my-db-host:5432",
         "databases": {
            "url": {
               "username": "my-db-owner",
                "password": {"$env": "DB_PASSWORD"}
            }
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

The values in this configuration are just examples, you will need to replace them with the correct values for your database.

ü•ê Build a Docker image by running `encore build docker url-shortener:v1.0`.

This will compile your application using the host machine and then produce a Docker image containing the compiled application.

ü•ê Upload the Docker image to the cloud provider of your choice and run it.

### Encore Cloud (free)

Encore Cloud provides automated infrastructure and DevOps. Deploy to a free development environment or to your own cloud account on AWS or GCP.

### Create account

Before deploying with Encore Cloud, you need to have a free Encore Cloud account and link your app to the platform. If you already have an account, you can move on to the next step.

If you don‚Äôt have an account, the simplest way to get set up is by running `encore app create` and selecting **Y** when prompted to create a new account. Once your account is set up, continue creating a new app, selecting the `empty app` template.

After creating the app, copy your project files into the new app directory, ensuring that you do not replace the `encore.app` file (this file holds a unique id which links your app to the platform).

### Commit changes

The final step before you deploy is to commit all changes to the project repo.

ü•ê Commit the new files to the project's git repo and trigger a deploy to Encore's free development cloud by running:

```shell
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git push encore
```

Encore will now build and test your app, provision the needed infrastructure, and deploy your application to the cloud.

After triggering the deployment, you will see a URL where you can view its progress in the [Encore Cloud dashboard](https://app.encore.cloud). It will look something like: `https://app.encore.cloud/$APP_ID/deploys/...`

<video autoPlay playsInline loop controls muted className="w-full h-full">
  <source src="/assets/docs/rest_tut_4.mp4" className="w-full h-full" type="video/mp4"/>
</video>

From there you can also see metrics, traces, and connect your own AWS or GCP account to use for production deployment.

*Now you have a fully fledged backend running in the cloud, well done!*

### Celebrate with fireworks

Now that your app is running in the cloud, let's celebrate with some fireworks:

ü•ê In the Cloud Dashboard, open the Command Menu by pressing **Cmd + K** (Mac) or **Ctrl + K** (Windows/Linux).

_From here you can easily access all Cloud Dashboard features and for example jump straight to specific services in the Service Catalog or view Traces for specific endpoints._

ü•ê Type `fireworks` in the Command Menu and press enter. Sit back and enjoy the show!

![Fireworks](/assets/docs/fireworks.jpg)

ü•ê A great next step is to [integrate with GitHub](/docs/platform/integrations/github). Once you've linked with GitHub, Encore will automatically start building and running tests against your Pull Requests.
