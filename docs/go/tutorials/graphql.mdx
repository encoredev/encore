Encore has great support for GraphQL with its type-safe approach to building APIs.

Encore's automatic tracing also makes it easy to find and fix
performance issues that often arise in GraphQL APIs (like the [N+1 problem](https://hygraph.com/blog/graphql-n-1-problem)).

The best way to use GraphQL with Encore is using [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com/), which
has similar goals as Encore (type-safe APIs, minimal boilerplate, code generation, etc).

The final code will look like this:

<div className="not-prose my-10">
   <Editor projectName="graphql" />
</div>

## 1. Create your Encore application

This tutorial uses the [REST API](/docs/go/tutorials/rest-api) tutorial as a starting point.

You can either follow that tutorial first, or you can create a new Encore application
using the `url-shortener` template by running:

```shell
$ encore app create --example=url-shortener
```

## 2. Initialize gqlgen

To get started, initialize gqlgen by creating a `tools.go` file in the application root:

```go
-- tools.go --
//go:build tools

package tools

import (
    _ "github.com/99designs/gqlgen"
    _ "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql/introspection"
)
```

Then run `go mod tidy` to download the dependencies.

Next, create a `gqlgen.yml` file in the application root containing:

```
-- gqlgen.yml --
# Where are all the schema files located? globs are supported eg  src/**/*.graphqls
schema:
  - graphql/*.graphqls

# Where should the generated server code go?
exec:
  filename: graphql/generated/generated.go
  package: generated

# Where should any generated models go?
model:
  filename: graphql/model/models_gen.go
  package: model

# Where should the resolver implementations go?
resolver:
  layout: follow-schema
  dir: graphql
  package: graphql

# gqlgen will search for any type names in the schema in these go packages
# if they match it will use them, otherwise it will generate them.
autobind:
 - "encore.app/url"

# This section declares type mapping between the GraphQL and go type systems
#
# The first line in each type will be used as defaults for resolver arguments and
# modelgen, the others will be allowed when binding to fields. Configure them to
# your liking
models:
  ID:
    model:
      - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.ID
      - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Int
      - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Int64
      - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Int32
  Int:
    model:
      - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Int
      - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Int64
      - github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql.Int32
```

## 3. Create Encore service

Now it's time to create our Encore service that will provide the GraphQL API.

First generate the gqlgen boilerplate:

```shell
$ mkdir -p graphql/generated graphql/model
$ echo "package model" > graphql/model/model.go
$ go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate
```

This will create a bunch of files in the `graphql` directory.

Next, create a `graphql/service.go` file containing:

```go
-- graphql/service.go --
// Service graphql exposes a GraphQL API.
package graphql

import (
    "net/http"

    "encore.app/graphql/generated"
    "encore.dev"
    "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql/handler"
    "github.com/99designs/gqlgen/graphql/playground"
)

//go:generate go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate

//encore:service
type Service struct {
    srv        *handler.Server
    playground http.Handler
}

func initService() (*Service, error) {
    srv := handler.NewDefaultServer(generated.NewExecutableSchema(generated.Config{Resolvers: &Resolver{}}))
    pg := playground.Handler("GraphQL Playground", "/graphql")
    return &Service{srv: srv, playground: pg}, nil
}

//encore:api public raw path=/graphql
func (s *Service) Query(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
    s.srv.ServeHTTP(w, req)
}

//encore:api public raw path=/graphql/playground
func (s *Service) Playground(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	// Disable playground in production
	if encore.Meta().Environment.Type == encore.EnvProduction {
        http.Error(w, "Playground disabled", http.StatusNotFound)
		return
    }

    s.playground.ServeHTTP(w, req)
}
```

This creates an Encore service that exposes the `/graphql` and `/graphql/playground` endpoints.

It also adds a `//go:generate` directive that lets you re-run the gqlgen code generation
by running `go generate ./graphql`.

## 4. Add GraphQL schema

Now it's time to define the GraphQL schema. Create a `graphql/schema.graphqls` file containing:

```
-- graphql/url.graphqls --
type Query {
  urls: [URL!]!
  get(id: ID!): URL!
}

type Mutation {
  shorten(input: String!): URL!
}

type URL {
  id:  ID!     # shortened id
  url: String! # full URL
}
```

Then, re-run the code generation to generate the resolver stubs:

```shell
$ go generate ./graphql
```
The stubs will be written to `graphql/url.resolvers.go` and will contain a bunch of unimplemented resolver methods
that look something like this:

```go
// Shorten is the resolver for the shorten field.
func (r *mutationResolver) Shorten(ctx context.Context, input string) (*url.URL, error) {
	panic(fmt.Errorf("not implemented: Shorten - shorten"))
}
```

## 5. Implement resolvers

Now, modify the resolvers to call the `url` service. Since the GraphQL API uses the same types
(thanks to the `autobind` directive in `gqlgen.yml`) as the Encore API exposes, we can just call the
endpoints directly. Implement the resolvers in `graphql/url.resolvers.go` like this:

```go
-- graphql/url.resolvers.go --
// Shorten is the resolver for the shorten field.
func (r *mutationResolver) Shorten(ctx context.Context, input string) (*url.URL, error) {
	return url.Shorten(ctx, &url.ShortenParams{URL: input})
}

// Urls is the resolver for the urls field.
func (r *queryResolver) Urls(ctx context.Context) ([]*url.URL, error) {
	resp, err := url.List(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return resp.URLs, nil
}

// Get is the resolver for the get field.
func (r *queryResolver) Get(ctx context.Context, id string) (*url.URL, error) {
	return url.Get(ctx, id)
}
```

As you can see, the resolvers are just thin wrappers around the Encore API endpoints themselves.

## 6. Trying it out

With that, the GraphQL API is done! Try it out by running `encore run` and opening up [the playground](http://localhost:4000/graphql/playground).

Enter the query:
```graphql
mutation {
    shorten(input: "https://encore.dev") {
        id
    }
}
```

You should get back an id like `MnTWA8Jo`. Pass the id you got (it will be something different) to a `get` query:

```graphql
query {
    get(id: "<your-id-here>") {
        url
    }
}
```

And you should get back `https://encore.dev`.


## 7. Deploy

<Accordion>

### Self-hosting

Encore supports building Docker images directly from the CLI, which can then be self-hosted on your own infrastructure of choice.

If your app is using infrastructure resources, such as SQL databases, Pub/Sub, or metrics, you will need to supply a [runtime configuration](/docs/go/self-host/configure-infra) your Docker image.

ü•ê Build a Docker image by running `encore build docker graphql:v1.0`.

This will compile your application using the host machine and then produce a Docker image containing the compiled application.

ü•ê Upload the Docker image to the cloud provider of your choice and run it.

### Deploy to Encore Cloud

Encore Cloud provides automated infrastructure and DevOps. Deploy to a free development environment or to your own cloud account on AWS or GCP.

### Create account

Before deploying with Encore Cloud, you need to have a free Encore Cloud account and link your app to the platform. If you already have an account, you can move on to the next step.

If you don‚Äôt have an account, the simplest way to get set up is by running `encore app create` and selecting **Y** when prompted to create a new account. Once your account is set up, continue creating a new app, selecting the `empty app` template.

After creating the app, copy your project files into the new app directory, ensuring that you do not replace the `encore.app` file (this file holds a unique id which links your app to the platform).

### Commit changes

The final step before you deploy is to commit all changes to the project repo.


Push your changes and deploy your application to Encore's free development cloud by running:

```shell
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git push encore
```

Encore will now build and test your app, provision the needed infrastructure, and deploy your application to the cloud.

After triggering the deployment, you will see a URL where you can view its progress in the [Encore Cloud dashboard](https://app.encore.cloud). It will look something like: `https://app.encore.cloud/$APP_ID/deploys/...`

From there you can also see metrics, traces, link your app to a GitHub repo to get automatic deploys on new commits, and connect your own AWS or GCP account to use for production deployment.

### Celebrate with fireworks

Now that your app is running in the cloud, let's celebrate with some fireworks:

ü•ê In the Cloud Dashboard, open the Command Menu by pressing **Cmd + K** (Mac) or **Ctrl + K** (Windows/Linux).

_From here you can easily access all Cloud Dashboard features and for example jump straight to specific services in the Service Catalog or view Traces for specific endpoints._

ü•ê Type `fireworks` in the Command Menu and press enter. Sit back and enjoy the show!

## Conclusion

We've now built a GraphQL API gateway that forwards requests to the application's
underlying Encore services in a type-safe way with minimal boilerplate.

Note that the concepts discussed here are general and can be easily adapted to any GraphQL schema.

Whenever you make a change to the schema or configuration, re-run `go generate ./graphql` to
regenerate the GraphQL boilerplate. And for more information on how to use `gqlgen`,
see the [gqlgen documentation](https://gqlgen.com/).
