If you are new to Encore, we recommend following the [quick start guide](/docs/go/quick-start).

## Install the Encore CLI
To develop locally with Encore, you first need to install the Encore CLI.
This is what provisions your local development environment, and runs your Local Development Dashboard complete with logs, tracing, and API documentation.

To locally run Encore apps with databases, you also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running.

### Optional: Add Encore LLM instructions

To help LLM powered tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot understand how to use Encore, you can add pre-made instructions to your app.

Download the [go_llm_instructions.txt](https://github.com/encoredev/encore/blob/main/go_llm_instructions.txt) file.
  
  **How to use:**
  - Cursor: Rename the file to `.cursorrules`.
  - GitHub Copilot: Paste content in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
  - For other tools, place the file in your app root.

### Build from source
If you prefer to build from source, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/encoredev/encore/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Update to the latest version
Check which version of Encore you have installed by running `encore version` in your terminal.
It should print something like:
```shell
encore version v1.28.0
```

If you think you're on an older version of Encore, you can easily update to the latest version by running
`encore version update` from your terminal.
