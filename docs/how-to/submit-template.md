[Templates](/templates) help and inspire developers to build applications using Encore.

You are welcome to contribute your own templates!

Two types of templates that are especially useful:
- **Starters:** Runnable Encore applications for others to use as is, or take inspiration from.
- **Bits:** Re-usable code samples to solve common development patterns or integrate Encore applications with third-party APIs and services.

## Submit your contribution

Contribute a template by submitting a Pull Request to the [Open Source Examples Repo](https://github.com/encoredev/examples): `https://github.com/encoredev/examples`

### Submitting Starters

Follow these steps to submit a **Starter**:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new folder in the root directory of the repo, this is where you will place your template. â€” Use a short folder name as your template will be installable via the CLI, like so: `encore app create APP-NAME --example=<TEMPLATE_FOLDER_NAME>`
3. Include a `README.md` with instructions for how to use the template. We recommend following [this format](https://github.com/encoredev/examples/blob/8c7e33243f6bfb1b2654839e996e9a924dcd309e/uptime/README.md).

Once your Pull Request has been approved, it may be featured on the [Templates page](/templates) on the Encore website.

### Submitting Bits

Follow these steps to submit your **Bits**:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a new folder inside the `bits` folder in the repo and place your template inside it. Use a short folder name as your template will soon be installable via the CLI.
3. Include a `README.md` with instructions for how to use the template.

Once your Pull Request has been approved, it may be featured on the [Templates page](/templates) on the Encore website.

## Contribute from your own repo

If you don't want to contribute code to the examples repo, but still want to be featured on the [Templates page](/templates), please contact us at [hello@encore.dev](mailto:hello@encore.dev).

## Dynamic Encore AppID

In most cases, you should avoid hardcoding an `AppID` in your template's source code. Instead, use the notation `{{ENCORE_APP_ID}}`.

When a developer creates an app using the template, `{{ENCORE_APP_ID}}` will be dymically replaced with their new and unique `AppID`, meaning they will not need to make any manual code adjustments.
