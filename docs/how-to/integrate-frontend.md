When developing with Encore, one of the great parts is that calling API endpoints
is just as easy as calling a function. This gives you a smooth developer experience complete with immediate
auto-completion and compile-time checking of the data you pass in.

However, calling APIs from another project like a website or a mobile app has traditionally been
a frustrating experience, involving lots of manual boilerplate to create type-safe client classes.

Not anymore. With Encore, you can [generate type-safe clients](/docs/develop/client-generation) to get all the same benefits for external projects.
