The Encore community is composed of developers that are building both hobby and commercial projects with Encore.

We rely on this group, and its contributions, to improve Encore. Getting involved is also a fantastic way of finding support and inspiration among peers.

Everyone is welcome in our community, and we want you to get involved too!
