Everyone is welcome in the Encore community, and it is of utmost importance to us that everyone is able to feel at home and contribute.

Therefore we as maintainers, and you as a contributor, must pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of: age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity.

### Code of Conduct

To this end, the Encore community is guided by the [Contributor Covenant 2.0 Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) to ensure everyone is welcome and able to participate.
