## Troubleshooting

**symlink creation error on Windows**

Encore currently relies on symbolic links, which may be disabled by default. A common fix for this issue is to enable "developer mode" in the Windows settings (Settings > System > For developers > Developer mode). 

**`node` errors**

You might need to restart the Encore daemon, e.g. if your PATH has changed since installing nvm. Restart the daemon by running `encore daemon`.
