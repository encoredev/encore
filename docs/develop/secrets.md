Wouldn't it be nice to store secret values like API keys, database passwords, and private keys directly in the source code?
Of course, we canâ€™t do that &ndash; it's horrifyingly insecure!
Unfortunately, it's also [very common](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss-paper/how-bad-can-it-git-characterizing-secret-leakage-in-public-github-repositories/).

So why does it happen? Because storing secrets securely used to be quite annoying.
Fortunately, Encore makes it easy.

## Defining secrets

With Encore you define secrets directly in your code by creating a struct:

```go
var secrets struct {
    SSHPrivateKey string    // ed25519 private key for SSH server
    GitHubAPIToken string   // personal access token for deployments
    // ...
}
```

<Callout type="important">

The variable must be an unexported struct named `secrets`, and all the fields must be of type `string` like you see above.

</Callout>

Then you set the secret value using `encore secret set --<dev|prod> <secret-name>`.
As you can see, secrets are defined per environment type. This makes it easy to set different secrets for production and development environments.
Your local development environment and preview environments are also `dev` environments.

For example `encore secret set --prod SSHPrivateKey` sets a production secret,<br/> and `encore secret set --dev GitHubAPIToken` sets a development and local development secret.

The values are stored safely using HashiCorp Vault, and delivered securely directly to your production environment.

### Using secrets

Once you've provided values for all the secrets, you can just use them in your program like a regular variable. For example:

```go
func callGitHub(ctx context.Context) {
    req, _ := http.NewRequestWithContext(ctx, "GET", "https:///api.github.com/user", nil)
    req.Header.Add("Authorization", "token " + secrets.GitHubAPIToken)
    resp, err := http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    // ... handle err and resp
}
```

Secret keys are globally unique for your whole application; if multiple services use the same secret name they both receive the same secret value at runtime.

<Callout type="info">

Once you've used secrets in your program, the Encore compiler will check that they are set before running or deploying your application.
