subtitle: Encore does it automatically, so you don't have to

All developers agree API documentation is great to have.
But the effort of maintaining inevitably leads to them becoming stale and out of date.

Encore provides the best of both worlds &mdash; great API docs that never become out of date &mdash;
by leveraging the [Encore Application Model](../application-model) to determine the structure of every API.

## Local development

You can also view API docs when developing locally.
When running your app with `encore run`, simply open up the API URL in your browser (by default `http://localhost:4000`).
You'll see the *local development dashboard* which gives you access to
request traces, logs and API docs for local development, right at your fingertips.
