Almost every application needs to know who's calling it, whether the user
represents a person in a consumer-facing app or an organization in a B2B app.
Encore supports both use cases in a simple yet powerful way.

As described in the docs for [defining APIs](/docs/primitives/apis), Encore offers three access levels
for APIs:

* `//encore:api public` &ndash; defines a public API that anybody on the internet can call.
* `//encore:api private` &ndash; defines a private API that is never accessible to the outside world. It can only be called from other services in your app and via cron jobs.
* `//encore:api auth` &ndash; defines a public API that anybody can call, but that requires valid authentication.

When an API is defined with access level `auth`, outside calls to that API must specify
an authorization header, in the form `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The token is passed to
a designated auth handler function and the API call is allowed to go through only if the
auth handler determines the token is valid.

For more advanced use cases you can also customize the authentication information you want.
See the section on [accepting structured auth information](#accepting-structured-auth-information) below.


<Callout type="info">

You can optionally send in auth data to `public` and `private` APIs, in which case the auth handler will be used. When used for `private` APIs, they are still not accessible from the outside world.

</Callout>

## The auth handler

Encore applications can designate a special function to handle authentication,
by defining a function and annotating it with `//encore:authhandler`. This annotation
tells Encore to run the function whenever an incoming API call contains authentication data.

The auth handler is responsible for validating the incoming authentication data
and returning an `auth.UID` (a string type representing a **user id**). The `auth.UID`
can be whatever you wish, but in practice it usually maps directly to the primary key
stored in a user table (either defined in the Encore service or in an external service like [Firebase](/docs/how-to/firebase-auth) or [Auth0](/docs/how-to/auth0-auth)).

### With custom user data

Oftentimes it's convenient for the rest of your application to easily be able to look up
information about the authenticated user making the request. If that's the case,
define the auth handler like so:

```go
import "encore.dev/beta/auth"

// Data can be named whatever you prefer (but must be exported).
type Data struct {
    Username string
    // ...
}

// AuthHandler can be named whatever you prefer (but must be exported).
//encore:authhandler
func AuthHandler(ctx context.Context, token string) (auth.UID, *Data, error) {
    // Validate the token and look up the user id and user data,
    // for example by calling Firebase Auth.
}
```

### Without custom user data

When you don't require custom user data and it's sufficient to use `auth.UID`,
simply skip it in the return type:

```go
import "encore.dev/beta/auth"

// AuthHandler can be named whatever you prefer (but must be exported).
//encore:authhandler
func AuthHandler(ctx context.Context, token string) (auth.UID, error) {
    // Validate the token and look up the user id,
    // for example by calling Firebase Auth.
}
```

## Accepting structured auth information

In the examples above the function accepts a `Bearer` token as a string argument.
In that case Encore parses the `Authorization` HTTP header and passes the token to the auth handler.

In cases where you have different or more complex authorization requirements, you can instead specify
a data structure that specifies one or more fields to be parsed from the HTTP request. For example:

```go
type MyAuthParams struct {
	// SessionCookie is set to the value of the "session" cookie.
	// If the cookie is not set it's nil.
	SessionCookie *http.Cookie `cookie:"session"`
	
	// ClientID is the unique id of the client, sourced from the URL query string.
	ClientID string `query:"client_id"`
	
	// Authorization is the raw value of the "Authorization" header
	// without any parsing.
	Authorization string `header:"Authorization"`
}

//encore:authhandler
func AuthHandler(ctx context.Context, p *MyAuthParams) (auth.UID, error) {
    // ...
}
```

This example tells Encore that the application accepts authentication information via
the `session` cookie, the `client_id` query string parameter, and the `Authorization` header.
These fields are automatically filled in when the auth handler is called (if present in the request).

You can of course combine auth params like this with custom user data (see the section above).

<Callout type="info">

Cookies are generally only used by browsers and are automatically added to requests made by browsers.
As a result Encore does not include cookie fields in generated clients' authentication payloads
or in the [Local Development Dashboard](/docs/observability/dev-dash).

</Callout>

## Handling auth errors

When a token doesn't match your auth rules (for example if it's expired, the token has been revoked, or the token is invalid), you should return a non-nil error from the auth handler.

Encore passes the error message on to the user when you use [Encore's built-in error package](errors), so we recommend using that with the error code `Unauthenticated` to communicate what happened. For example:

```go
import "encore.dev/beta/errs"

//encore:authhandler
func AuthHandler(ctx context.Context, token string) (auth.UID, error) {
    return "", &errs.Error{
        Code: errs.Unauthenticated,
        Message: "invalid token",
    }
}
```

<Callout type="important">

Note that for security reasons you may not want to reveal too much information about why a request did not pass your auth checks. There are many subtle security considerations when dealing with authentication and we don't have time to go into all of them here.

Whenever possible we recommend using a third-party auth provider instead of rolling your own authentication.

## Using auth data

Once the user has been identified by the auth handler, the API handler is called
as usual. If it wishes to inspect the authenticated user, it can use the
`encore.dev/beta/auth` package:

- `auth.Data()` returns the custom user data returned by the auth handler (if any)
- `auth.UserID()` returns `(auth.UID, bool)` to get the authenticated user id (if any)

For an incoming request from the outside to an API that uses the `auth` access level,
these are guaranteed to be set since the API won't be called if the auth handler doesn't succeed.

Encore automatically propagates the auth data when you make API calls to other Encore API endpoints.

<Callout type="info">

If an endpoint calls another endpoint during its processing, and the original
does not have an authenticated user, the request will fail. This behavior
preserves the guarantees that `auth` endpoints always have an authenticated user.

</Callout>


## Optional authentication

While Encore always calls the auth handler for API endpoints marked as `auth`, you can also call `public` API endpoints with authentication data.

This can be useful for APIs that support both a "logged in" and "logged out" experience.
For example, a site like Reddit might have a `post.List` endpoint that returns the list of posts,
but if you're logged in it also includes whether or not you have upvoted or downvoted each post.

To support such use cases, Encore runs the auth handler for `public` API endpoints if (and only if) the request
includes any authentication information (such as the `Authorization` header).

In that case, the request processing behavior varies depending on the value of the `error` returned from the auth handler:

* If the error is nil, the request is considered to be an authenticated request and `auth.UID()` and `auth.Data()` will include
  the information the auth handler returned.
* If the error is non-nil and the error code is `errs.Unauthenticated` (like shown above), the request continues as an unauthenticated request,
  behaving exactly as if there was no authentication data provided at all.
* If the error is non-nil and the error code is anything else, the request is aborted and Encore returns that error to the caller.

To be able to determine if the request has an authenticated user, check the second return value from `auth.UserID()`.

## Overriding auth information

Encore supports overriding the auth information for an outgoing request using the
[`auth.WithContext`](https://pkg.go.dev/encore.dev/beta/auth#WithContext) function.
This function returns a new context with the auth information set to the specified values.

Note that this only affects the auth information passed along with the request, and not the
current request being processed (if any).

This function is often useful when testing APIs that use authentication. For example:

```go
ctx := auth.WithContext(context.Background(), auth.UID("my-user-id"), &MyAuthData{Email: "hello@example.com"})
// ... Make an API call using `ctx` to override the auth information for that API call.
```
