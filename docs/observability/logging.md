Encore provides built-in support for **Structured Logging**, meaning log messages that combine a free-form log message with structured and type-safe key-value pairs. This powerful combination enables straightforward, ad-hoc analysis of what your application is doing, in a way that is easy for a computer to parse and analyze.

Structured logging also enables the logs to be easily indexed, meaning they can be quickly filtered and searched through to find all logs that match a particular query.

Encore’s built-in logging support is fully integrated with its Distributed Tracing, which means that all logs you emit automatically become included in the active trace. This dramatically simplifies debugging of your application.

## Usage
First, import `encore.dev/rlog` in your package. Then simply call one of the package methods `Info`, `Error`, or `Debug`. For example:

```go
rlog.Info("log message",
	"user_id", 12345,
	"is_subscriber", true)
rlog.Error("something went terribly wrong!",
	"err", err)
```

The first parameter is the log message. After that follows zero or more key-value pairs for structured logging for context.

If you’re logging many log messages with the same key-value pairs each time it can be a bit cumbersome. To help with that, use `rlog.With()` to group them into a context object, which then copies the key-value pairs into each log event:

```go
ctx := rlog.With("user_id", 12345)
ctx.Info("user logged in", "is_subscriber", true) // includes user_id=12345
```

For more information, see the [API Documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/encore.dev/rlog).

## Live-streaming logs

Encore also makes it easy to live-stream logs directly to your terminal from any environment,
simply by running:

```
$ encore logs --env=prod
```
