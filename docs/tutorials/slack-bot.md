In this tutorial you will create a Slack bot that brings the greatness of the `cowsay` utility to Slack!

<Callout type="info">

To make it easier to follow along, we've laid out a trail of croissants to guide your way.
Whenever you see a ü•ê it means there's something for you to do.

</Callout>

## Create your Encore application

ü•ê Create a new Encore application by running `encore app create` and select `Empty app` as the template.
**Take a note of your app id, we'll need it in the next step.**

## Creating our Slack app

ü•ê The first step is to create a new Slack app:

1. Head over to [Slack's API site](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app.
2. When prompted, choose to create the app **from an app manifest**.
3. Choose a workspace to install the app in.

ü•ê Enter the following manifest (replace `$APP_ID` in the URL below with your app id from above):

```yaml
_metadata:
  major_version: 1
display_information:
  name: Encore Bot
  description: Cowsay for the cloud age.
features:
  slash_commands:
    - command: /cowsay
      # Replace $APP_ID below
      url: https://staging-$APP_ID.encr.app/cowsay
      description: Say things with a flair!
      usage_hint: your message here
      should_escape: false
  bot_user:
    display_name: encore-bot
    always_online: true
oauth_config:
  scopes:
    bot:
      - commands
      - chat:write
      - chat:write.public
settings:
  org_deploy_enabled: false
  socket_mode_enabled: false
  token_rotation_enabled: false
```

Once created, we're ready to move on with implementing our Encore endpoint!

## Implementing the Slack endpoint

Since Slack sends custom HTTP headers that we need to pay attention to, we're going to
use a raw endpoint in Encore. For more information on this check out Slack's documentation
on [Enabling interactivity with Slash Commands](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/slash-commands).

ü•ê In your Encore app, create a new directory named `slack` and create a file `slack/slack.go` with the following contents:

```go
package slack

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

// cowart is the formatting string for printing the cow art.
const cowart = "Moo! %s"

//encore:api public raw path=/cowsay
func Cowsay(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	text := req.FormValue("text")
	data, _ := json.Marshal(map[string]string{
		"response_type": "in_channel",
		"text":          fmt.Sprintf(cowart, text),
	})
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	w.WriteHeader(200)
	w.Write(data)
}
```

Let's try it out locally.

ü•ê Start your app with `encore run` and then call it in another terminal:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/cowsay -d 'text=Eat your greens!'
{"response_type":"in_channel","text":"Moo! Eat your greens!"}
```

Looks great!

ü•ê Next, let's deploy it to the cloud:

```shell
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git push encore
```

Once deployed, we're ready to try our Slack command!

ü•ê Head over to the workspace you installed the app in and run `/cowsay Hello there`.
You should see something like this:

![Cowsay](https://encore.dev/assets/docs/cowsay-wip.png "Cowsay (Work in Progress)")

And just like that we have a fully working Slack integration.

## Secure the webhook endpoint

In order to get up and running quickly we ignored one important aspect for a production-ready Slack app:
verifying that the webhook requests are actually coming from Slack. Let's do that now!

The Slack documentation covers this really well on the [Verifying requests from Slack](https://api.slack.com/authentication/verifying-requests-from-slack) page.

In short, what we need to do is:

1. Save a shared secret that Slack provides us
2. Use the secret to verify that the request comes from Slack, using HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code).

### Save the shared secret

Let's define a secret using Encore's secrets management functionality.

ü•ê Add this to your `slack.go` file:

```go
var secrets struct {
	SlackSigningSecret string
}
```

ü•ê Head over to the configuration section for your Slack app (go to [Your Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) &rarr; select your app &rarr; Basic Information).

ü•ê Copy the **Signing Secret** and then run `encore secret set --prod SlackSigningSecret` and paste the secret.

ü•ê For local development you will also want to set `encore secret set --dev SlackSigningSecret`.
You can use the same secret value or a placeholder value.

### Compute the HMAC

Go makes computing HMAC very straightforward, but it's still a fair amount of code.

ü•ê Add a few more imports to your file, so that it reads:
```go
import (
	"crypto/hmac"
	"crypto/sha256"
	"encoding/hex"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"
	"net/http"
	"net/url"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"time"

	"encore.dev/beta/errs"
	"encore.dev/rlog"
)
```

ü•ê Next, we'll add the `verifyRequest` function:

```go
// verifyRequest verifies that a request is coming from Slack.
func verifyRequest(req *http.Request) (body []byte, err error) {
	eb := errs.B().Code(errs.InvalidArgument)
	body, err = ioutil.ReadAll(req.Body)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, eb.Cause(err).Err()
	}

	// Compare timestamps to prevent replay attack
	ts := req.Header.Get("X-Slack-Request-Timestamp")
	threshold := int64(5 * 60)
	n, _ := strconv.ParseInt(ts, 10, 64)
	if diff := time.Now().Unix() - n; diff > threshold || diff < -threshold {
		return body, eb.Msg("message not recent").Err()
	}

	// Compare HMAC signature
	sig := req.Header.Get("X-Slack-Signature")
	prefix := "v0="
	if !strings.HasPrefix(sig, prefix) {
		return body, eb.Msg("invalid signature").Err()
	}
	gotMac, _ := hex.DecodeString(sig[len(prefix):])

	mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte(secrets.SlackSigningSecret))
	fmt.Fprintf(mac, "v0:%s:", ts)
	mac.Write(body)
	expectedMac := mac.Sum(nil)
	if !hmac.Equal(gotMac, expectedMac) {
		return body, eb.Msg("bad mac").Err()
	}
	return body, nil
}
```

<Callout type="info">

As you can see, this function needs to consume the whole HTTP body in order to compute the HMAC.

This breaks the use of `req.FormValue("text")` that we used earlier, since it relies on reading the HTTP body. That's the reason we're returning the body from `verifyRequest`, so that we can parse the form values from that directly instead.

</Callout>

We're now ready to verify the signature.

ü•ê Update the `Cowsay` function to look like this:

```go
//encore:api public raw path=/cowsay
func Cowsay(w http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	body, err := verifyRequest(req)
	if err != nil {
		errs.HTTPError(w, err)
		return
	}
	q, _ := url.ParseQuery(string(body))
	text := q.Get("text")
	data, _ := json.Marshal(map[string]string{
		"response_type": "in_channel",
		"text":          fmt.Sprintf(cowart, text),
	})
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	w.WriteHeader(200)
	w.Write(data)
}
```

## Putting it all together

Finally we're ready to put it all together.

ü•ê Update the `cowart` like so:

```go
const cowart = `
 ________________________________________
< %- 38s >
 ----------------------------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
`
```

ü•ê Finally, let's commit our changes and deploy it:

```shell
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m 'Verify webhook requests and improve art'
$ git push encore
```

ü•ê Once deployed, head back to Slack and run `/cowsay Hello there`.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see:

![Slack Cowsay](https://encore.dev/assets/docs/cowsay.png "Slack bot")

And there we go, a production-ready Slack bot in less than 100 lines of code.

Well done!
