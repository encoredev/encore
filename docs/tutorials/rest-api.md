subtitle: Learn how to build a URL shortener with a REST API and SQL database
---

In this tutorial you will create a REST API for a URL Shortener service. In a few short minutes, you'll learn how to:

* Create REST APIs with Encore
* Use PostgreSQL databases
* Create and run tests

_Let‚Äôs get going!_

To make it easier to follow along, we've laid out a trail of croissants to guide your way.
Whenever you see a ü•ê it means there's something for you to do.

</Callout>

## API structure


REST APIs are resource-oriented, meaning that we start by identifying the resources our app needs and design the URL hierarchy based on them. For our URL Shortener we‚Äôll have just a single resource: the URL.

Our API structure will be:

* `POST /url` ‚Äî Create a new, shortened URL (returns id)
* `GET /url/:id` ‚Äî Returns the full URL given an id


## Creating our Shorten endpoint
We start by defining a new `url` service. You can use the Encore application you created in the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start "Quick Start") guide or create a new one from scratch, it‚Äôs up to you.

ü•ê Create a new folder `url` and create a new file `url/url.go` that looks like this:

```go
package url

import (
	"context"
	"crypto/rand"
	"encoding/base64"
)

type URL struct {
	ID  string // short-form URL id
	URL string // complete URL, in long form
}

type ShortenParams struct {
	URL string // the URL to shorten
}

// Shorten shortens a URL.
//encore:api public method=POST path=/url
func Shorten(ctx context.Context, p *ShortenParams) (*URL, error) {
	id, err := generateID()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return &URL{ID: id, URL: p.URL}, nil
}

// generateID generates a random short ID.
func generateID() (string, error) {
	var data [6]byte // 6 bytes of entropy
	if _, err := rand.Read(data[:]); err != nil {
		return "", err
	}
	return base64.RawURLEncoding.EncodeToString(data[:]), nil
}
```

This sets up the `POST /url` endpoint (see the `//encore:api` annotation on the `Shorten` function).

ü•ê Let‚Äôs see if it works! Start your app by running `encore run`.

You should see this:

```bash
API Base URL:      http://localhost:4000
Dev Dashboard URL: http://localhost:62709/hello-world-cgu2
4:19PM INF registered endpoint path=/url service=url endpoint=Shorten
```

ü•ê Next, call your endpoint:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url -d '{"URL": "https://encore.dev"}'
```

You should see this:

```bash
{
  "ID": "5cJpBVRp",
  "URL": "https://encore.dev"
}
```

It works! There‚Äôs just one problem...

Right now, we‚Äôre not actually storing the URL anywhere. That means we can generate shortened IDs but there‚Äôs no way to get back to the original URL! We need to store a mapping from the short ID to the complete URL.

## Saving URLs in a database
Fortunately, Encore makes it really easy to set up a PostgreSQL database to store our data. To do so, we first define a **database schema**, in the form of a migration file.

ü•ê Create a new folder named `migrations` inside the `url` folder. Then, inside the `migrations` folder, create an initial database migration file named `1_create_tables.up.sql`. The file name format is important (it must start with `1_` and end in `.up.sql`).

ü•ê Add the following contents to the file:

```sql
CREATE TABLE url (
	id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
	original_url TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

ü•ê Next, go back to the `url/url.go` file and import the `encore.dev/storage/sqldb` package by modifying the import statement to become:

```go
import (
	"context"
	"crypto/rand"
	"encoding/base64"

	"encore.dev/storage/sqldb"
)
```

ü•ê Now, to insert data into our database, let‚Äôs create a helper function `insert`:

```go
// insert inserts a URL into the database.
func insert(ctx context.Context, id, url string) error {
	_, err := sqldb.Exec(ctx, `
		INSERT INTO url (id, original_url)
		VALUES ($1, $2)
	`, id, url)
	return err
}
```

ü•ê Lastly, we can update our `Shorten` function to insert into the database:

```go
func Shorten(ctx context.Context, p *ShortenParams) (*URL, error) {
	id, err := generateID()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	} else if err := insert(ctx, id, p.URL); err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return &URL{ID: id, URL: p.URL}, nil
}
```

<Callout type="important">

Before running your application, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed and running. It's required to locally run Encore applications with databases.

</Callout>

ü•ê Next, start the application again with `encore run` and Encore automatically sets up your database.

(In case your application won't run, check the [databases troubleshooting guide](/docs/develop/databases#troubleshooting).)

ü•ê Now let's call the API again:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url -d '{"URL": "https://encore.dev"}'
```

ü•ê Finally, let's verify that it was saved in the database by running  `encore db shell url` from the app root directory:

```shell
$ encore db shell url
psql (13.1, server 11.12)
Type "help" for help.

url=# select * from url;
    id    |    original_url     
----------+--------------------
 zr6RmZc4 | https://encore.dev
(1 row)
```

That was easy!

## Retrieving the full URL
To complete our URL shortener API, let‚Äôs add the endpoint to retrieve a URL given its short id.

ü•ê Add this endpoint to `url/url.go`:

```go
// Get retrieves the original URL for the id.
//encore:api public method=GET path=/url/:id
func Get(ctx context.Context, id string) (*URL, error) {
	u := &URL{ID: id}
	err := sqldb.QueryRow(ctx, `
		SELECT original_url FROM url
		WHERE id = $1
	`, id).Scan(&u.URL)
	return u, err
}
```

Encore uses the `path=/url/:id` syntax to represent a path with a parameter. The `id` name corresponds to the parameter name in the function signature. In this case it is of type `string`, but you can also use other built-in types like `int` or `bool` if you want to restrict the values.

ü•ê Let‚Äôs make sure it works by calling it:

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:4000/url/zr6RmZc4
```

You should now see this:

```bash
{
  "ID": "zr6RmZc4",
  "URL": "https://encore.dev"
}
```

And there you have it! That's how you build REST APIs in Encore.

## Add a test and deploy

Before deployment, it is good practice to have tests to assure that
the service works properly. Such tests including database access
are easy to write.

We've prepared a test to check that the whole cycle of shortening
the URL, storing and then retrieving the original URL works. It looks like this:

```go
package url

import (
	"context"
	"testing"
)

// TestShortenAndRetrieve - test that the shortened URL is stored and retrieved from database.
func TestShortenAndRetrieve(t *testing.T) {
	testURL := "https://github.com/encoredev/encore"
	sp := ShortenParams{URL: testURL}
	resp, err := Shorten(context.Background(), &sp)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}
	wantURL := testURL
	if resp.URL != wantURL {
		t.Errorf("got %q, want %q", resp.URL, wantURL)
	}

	firstURL := resp
	gotURL, err := Get(context.Background(), firstURL.ID)
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatal(err)
	}
	if *gotURL != *firstURL {
		t.Errorf("got %v, want %v", *gotURL, *firstURL)
	}
}
```

ü•ê Save this in a separate file `url/url_test.go`.

ü•ê Now run `encore test ./...` to verify that it's working.

A final step before you deploy is to commit all changes to the project repo.

ü•ê Commit the new files to the project's git repo by running:

```shell
$ git add url
$ git commit -m 'working service including test'
```

ü•ê Then you can finally deploy your application to the cloud by running:

```shell
$ git push encore
```
This will trigger a deployment and Encore will build and test your app, provision the necessary infrastructure (including databases), and deploy your app to the cloud.

ü•ê Head to the [web platform](https://app.encore.dev) to follow the progress of your deployment.

*Now you have a fully fledged backend running in the cloud, well done!*

## What's next

Now that you know how to build a backend with a database, you're ready to let your creativity flow and begin building your next great idea!

ü•ê A great next step is to [integrate with GitHub](/docs/how-to/github). Once you've linked with GitHub, Encore will automatically start building and running tests against your Pull Requests.

We're excited to hear what you're going to build with Encore, join the pioneering developer community on [Slack](/slack) and share your story.
