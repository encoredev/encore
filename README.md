## Introduction to Encore

Building scalable applications with cloud services is powerful but often frustrating. Developers face complex setups and repetitive tasks that slow them down.

Encore solves this with an all-in-one backend development toolkit, streamlining everything from local testing to cloud integration and DevOps.

<p align="center">
<img width="589" alt="Encore Overview" src="https://github.com/encoredev/encore/assets/78424526/ecb65a20-866c-449c-bf0e-e6d99c78430b">
</p>

### How it works

Encore's open source backend frameworks [Encore.ts](https://encore.dev/docs/ts) and [Encore.go](https://encore.dev/docs/primitives/overview) enable you to define resources like services, databases, cron jobs, and Pub/Sub, as type-safe objects in your application code.

With the frameworks you only define **infrastructure semantics** ‚Äî _the things that matter to your application's behavior_ ‚Äî not configuration for _specific_ cloud services. Encore parses your application and builds a graph of both its logical architecture and its infrastructure requirements, it then automatically generates boilerplate and helps orchestrate the relevant infrastructure for each environment. This means the same application code can be used to run locally, test in preview environments, and deploy to cloud environments on e.g. AWS and GCP.

This often removes the need for separate infrastructure configuration like Terraform, increases standardization in both your codebase and infrastructure, and makes your application highly portable across cloud providers.

Encore is fully open source, there is **no proprietary code running in your application**.

### Example: Hello World

Defining microservices and API endpoints is incredibly simple‚Äîwith less than 10 lines of code, you can create a production-ready, deployable service.

**Hello World in Encore.ts**

```typescript
import { api } from "encore.dev/api";

export const get = api(
  { expose: true, method: "GET", path: "/hello/:name" },
  async ({ name }: { name: string }): Promise<Response> => {
    const msg = `Hello ${name}!`;
    return { message: msg };
  }
);

interface Response {
  message: string;
}
```

**Hello World in Encore.go**

```go
package hello

//encore:api public path=/hello/:name
func World(ctx context.Context, name string) (*Response, error) {
	msg := fmt.Sprintf("Hello, %s!", name)
	return &Response{Message: msg}, nil
}

type Response struct {
	Message string
}
```

### Example: Using Pub/Sub

If you want a Pub/Sub Topic, you declare it directly in your application code and Encore will integrate the infrastructure and generate the boilerplate code necessary.
Encore supports the following Pub/Sub infrastructure:
- **NSQ** for local environments (automatically provisioned by Encore's CLI)
- **GCP Pub/Sub** for environments on GCP
- **SNS/SQS** for environments on AWS

**Using Pub/Sub in Encore.ts**

```typescript
import { Topic } "encore.dev/pubsub"

export interface SignupEvent {
    userID: string;
}

export const signups = new Topic<SignupEvent>("signups", {
    deliveryGuarantee: "at-least-once",
});
```

**Using Pub/Sub in Encore.go**

```go
import "encore.dev/pubsub"

type User struct { /* fields... */ }

var Signup = pubsub.NewTopic[*User]("signup", pubsub.TopicConfig{
  DeliveryGuarantee: pubsub.AtLeastOnce,
})

// Publish messages by calling a method
Signup.Publish(ctx, &User{...})
```

## Using Encore: An end-to-end workflow from local to cloud

Encore provides purpose-built tooling for each step in the development process, from local development and testing, to cloud DevOps. Here we'll cover the key features for each part of the process.

### Local Development

<p align="center">
<img width="578" alt="Local Development" src="https://github.com/encoredev/encore/assets/78424526/6bf682bb-f57e-4a02-9c92-ff83f7fb59d2">
</p>

When you run your app locally using the [Encore CLI](https://encore.dev/docs/install), Encore parses your code and automatically sets up the necessary local infrastructure on the fly. _No more messing around with Docker Compose!_

You also get built-in tools for an efficient workflow when creating distributed systems and event-driven applications:

- **Local environment matches cloud:** Encore automatically handles the semantics of service communication and interfacing with different types of infrastructure services, so that the local environment is a 1:1 representation of your cloud environment.
- **Cross-service type-safety:** When building microservices applications with Encore, you get type-safety and auto-complete in your IDE when making cross-service API calls.
- **Type-aware infrastructure:** With Encore, infrastructure like Pub/Sub queues are type-aware objects in your program. This enables full end-to-end type-safety when building event-driven applications.
- **Secrets management:** Built-in [secrets management](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/primitives/secrets) for all environments.
- **Tracing:** The [local development dashboard](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/observability/dev-dash) provides local tracing to help understand application behavior and find bugs.
- **Automatic API docs & clients:** Encore generates [API docs](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/obsevability/service-catalog) and [API clients](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/cli/client-generation) in Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, and OpenAPI specification.

_Here's a video showing the local development dashboard:_

https://github.com/encoredev/encore/assets/78424526/4d066c76-9e6c-4c0e-b4c7-6b2ba6161dc8

### Testing

<p align="center">
<img width="573" alt="testing" src="https://github.com/encoredev/encore/assets/78424526/516a043c-66ac-464e-a4ca-f8ecd5642d54">
</p>

Encore comes with several built-in tools to help with testing:

- **Built-in service/API mocking:** Encore provides built-in support for [mocking API calls](https://encore.dev/docs/go/develop/testing/mocking), and interfaces for automatically generating mock objects for your services.
- **Local test infra:** When running tests locally, Encore automatically provides dedicated [test infrastructure](https://encore.dev/docs/go/develop/testing#test-only-infrastructure) to isolate individual tests.
- **Local test tracing:** The [Local Development Dashboard](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/observability/dev-dash) provides distributed tracing for tests, providing great visibility into what's happening and making it easier to understand why a test failed.
- **Preview Environments:** When using Encore Cloud (optional), it automatically provisions a temporary cloud-based [Preview Environment](https://encore.dev/docs/platform/deploy/preview-environments) for each Pull Request, an effective tool when doing end-to-end testing.

### Optional: Automate your AWS/GCP with Encore Cloud

<p align="center">
<img width="573" alt="DevOps" src="https://github.com/encoredev/encore/assets/78424526/e00d3e92-3301-4f3a-89cc-575c4a520aae">
</p>

Encore Cloud is Encore's managed service offering for teams wanting to focus their engineering effort on their product development, avoiding investing time in platformization and DevOps.

Encore Cloud provides **automatic infrastructure provisioning in your cloud on AWS & GCP**. So instead of writing Terraform, YAML, or clicking in cloud consoles, you [connect your cloud account](https://encore.dev/docs/platform/deploy/own-cloud) and simply deploy your application. Since using Encore's open source backend frameworks means your application code is cloud agnostic and not tied to any specific infrastructure services, Encore Cloud enables you to change your infrastructure depending on your evolving needs, without needing to make code changes or manually update infrastructure config files.

When you deploy, Encore Cloud automatically provisions [infrastructure](https://encore.dev/docs/platform/infrastructure/infra) using battle-tested cloud services on AWS and GCP, such as:
- **Compute:** GCP Cloud Run, AWS Fargate, Kubernetes (GKE and EKS)
- **Databases:** GCP Cloud SQL, AWS RDS
- **Pub/Sub:** GCP Pub/Sub, AWS SQS/SNS
- **Caches:** GCP Memorystore, Amazon ElastiCache
- **Object Storage:** GCS, Amazon S3
- **Secrets:**	GCP Secret Manager, AWS Secrets Manager
- Etc.

Encore Cloud also includes cloud versions of Encore's built-in development tools:

- [Service Catalog & API Docs](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/observability/service-catalog)
- [Architecture Diagrams](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/observability/flow)
- [Tracing](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/observability/tracing)

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Who's behind Encore?

Encore was founded by long-time backend engineers from Spotify, Google, and Monzo with over 50 years of collective experience. We‚Äôve lived through the challenges of building complex distributed systems with thousands of services, and scaling to hundreds of millions of users.

Encore grew out of these experiences and is a solution to the frustrations that came with them: unnecessary crippling complexity and constant repetition of undifferentiated work that suffocates the developer‚Äôs creativity. With Encore, we want to set developers free to achieve their creative potential.

### Who is Encore for?

**For individual developers** building for the cloud, Encore provides a radically improved experience. With Encore you‚Äôre able to stay in the flow state and experience the joy and creativity of building.

**For startup teams** who need to build a scalable backend to support the growth of their product, Encore lets them get up and running in the cloud within minutes. It lets them focus on solving the needs of their users, instead of spending most of their time re-solving the everyday challenges of building distributed systems in the cloud.

**For individual teams in large organizations** that want to focus on innovating and building new features, Encore lets them stop spending time on operations and onboarding new team members. Using Encore for new feature development is easy, just spin up a new backend service in a few minutes.

### How is Encore different?

Encore is the only tool that understands what you‚Äôre building. Encore uses static analysis to deeply understand the application you‚Äôre building. This enables a unique developer experience that helps you stay in the flow as you‚Äôre building. For instance, you don't need to bother with configuring and managing infrastructure, setting up environments and keeping them in sync, or writing documentation and drafting architecture diagrams. Encore does all of this automatically out of the box.

### Why does Encore provide infrastructure integrations through Encore Cloud?

We've found that to meaningfully improve the developer experience, you have to operate across the full stack. Unless you understand how an application is deployed, there are a large number of things in the development process that you can't simplify. That's why so many other developer tools have such a limited impact. With Encore's more integrated approach, we're able to unlock a radically better experience for developers.

### What if I want to migrate away from Encore?

Encore is designed to let you go outside of the framework when you want to, and easily drop down in abstraction level when you need to, so you never run into any dead-ends.

Should you want to migrate away, it's straightforward and does not require a big rewrite. 99% of your code is regular Go or TypeScript.

Encore provides tools for [self-hosting](https://encore.dev/docs/ts/self-host/build) your application, by using the Open Source CLI to produce a standalone Docker image that can be deployed anywhere you'd like.
