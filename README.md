  <h1><a href="https://encore.dev">Encore ‚Äì Backend Development Engine</a></h1>
Encore is a Backend Development Engine, purpose-built for a flow state developer experience when creating cloud-based backend applications, APIs, and distributed systems using Go. With Encore you build microservices with the same simple developer experience as building a monolith. You write your business logic with the Open Source Encore Go framework, then let the Encore platform analyze your code to automatically deal with the rest.
Start building today and unlock your creative potential with:</br>

- No endless repetition of boilerplate.

- No orchestrating and managing cloud services.

- No reinventing the wheel.

## Key features

- **[Write a function, get an API](https://encore.dev/docs/develop/services-and-apis):** Call any function as an API by adding a single annotation.

- **[Microservices without hassle](https://encore.dev/docs/develop/services-and-apis):** Define services and API endpoints with a single line of Go code. Create multiple services as easy as creating Go packages.

- **[Cloud primitives at your fingertips](https://encore.dev/docs/introduction#a-developer-experience-designed-to-help-you-stay-in-the-flow):** Primitives like databases, queues, and scheduled tasks, are native concepts that you express through Go code.

- **[Built-in DevOps](https://encore.dev/docs/introduction#3-encore-takes-care-of-your-entire-devops-process):** Run `git push encore` to build, test, provision necessary infrastructure, and deploy.

- **[One developer experience, unlimited environments](https://encore.dev/docs/deploy/environments):** All features work the same in any environment, including local development. Create as many or as few environments as you wish.

- **[Infrastructure Provisioning in your own cloud account](https://encore.dev/docs/deploy/own-cloud):** Encore understands how your application works,
  and provisions and manages your cloud infrastructure in your own account. Works with all the major cloud providers, including AWS/Azure/GCP. Encore also offers free build-in cloud hosting for development.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Who's behind Encore?

Encore was founded by long-time backend engineers from Spotify, Google and Monzo with over 50 years of collective experience. We‚Äôve lived through the challenges of building complex distributed systems with thousands of services, and scaling to hundreds of millions of users.

Encore grew out of these experiences and is a solution to the frustrations that came with them: unnecessary crippling complexity and constant repetition of undifferentiated work that suffocates the developer‚Äôs creativity. With Encore, we want to set developers free to achieve their creative potential.

### Who is Encore for?

For individual developers building for the cloud, Encore provides a radically improved experience. With Encore you‚Äôre able to stay in the flowstate and experience the joy and creativity of building.

For startup teams who need to build a scalable backend to support the growth of their product, Encore lets them get up and running in the cloud within minutes. It lets them focus on solving the needs of their users, instead of spending most of their time re-solving the everyday challenges of building distributed systems in the cloud.

For teams in mature organizations that want to focus on innovating and building new features, Encore lets them stop spending time on operations and onboarding new team members. Using Encore for new feature development is easy, just spin up a new backend service in a few minutes.

### How is Encore different?

Encore is the only tool that understands what you‚Äôre building. The Encore framework, coupled with static analysis, lets Encore deeply understand the application you‚Äôre building. This enables the platform to provide a unique developer experience that helps you stay in the flowstate as you‚Äôre building. For instance you don't need to bother with configuring and managing infrastructure, setting up environments and keeping them in sync, or writing documentation and drafting architecture diagrams. Encore does all of this automatically out of the box.

Unlike many tools that aim to only make cloud deployment easier, Encore is not a cloud hosting provider. With Encore, you can use your own cloud account with all the major cloud providers: AWS/Azure/GCP. This means you‚Äôre in control of your data and can maintain your trust relationship with your cloud provider. You can also use Encore's development cloud for free, with pretty generous "fair use" limits.

### Why is the framework integrated with cloud hosting?

We've found that to meaningfully improve the developer experience, you have to operate across the full stack. Unless you understand how an application is deployed, there are a large number of things in the development process that you can't simplify. That's why so many other developer tools have such a limited impact. With Encore's more integrated approach, we're able to unlock a radically better experience for developers.

### What if I want to migrate away from Encore?

Encore has been designed to let you go outside of the framework when you want to, and easily drop down in abstraction level when you need to. This means you're not likely to run into any "dead ends".

If you really do want to migrate away, it's relatively easy to do. Because when you build an Encore application, the vast majority of code is just plain Go. So in practice, the amount of code specific to Encore is very small.

Encore has built-in support for [ejecting](https://encore.dev/docs/how-to/migrate-away#ejecting) your application as a way of removing the connection to the Encore Platform. Ejecting your app produces a standalone Docker image that can be deployed anywhere you'd like, and can help facilitate the migration away according to the process above.

Migrating away is also very low risk, since Encore deploys to your own cloud account from the start, so there's never any data to migrate.

Open Source also plays a role. Encore's code generation, compiler, and parser are all open source and can be used however you want. So if you run into something unforeseen down the line, you have free access to the tools you might need.

And since Encore is about building distributed systems, it's quite straightforward to use it in combination with other backends that aren't built with Encore. So if you come across a use case where Encore for some reason doesn't fit, you won't need to tear everything up and start from scratch. You can just build that specific part without Encore.

It's our belief that adopting Encore is a low-risk decision, given it needs no initial investment in foundational work. The ambition is to simply add a lot of value to your everyday development process, from day one.
